## ClassDef Filter
**Filter**: The function of Filter is to define the filtering options for a specific model.

**attributes**: 
- model: Specifies the model to which the filters will be applied.
- fields: Defines the fields of the model along with the filter options available for each field.

**Code Description**:
The Filter class is a subclass of FilterSet and is used to specify the filtering options for a particular model. Within the class, the Meta inner class is defined to set the model attribute to ListModel and the fields attribute to a dictionary containing the fields of the model along with the filter options available for each field. In this case, the "id" field has filter options such as 'exact', 'iexact', 'gt', 'gte', 'lt', 'lte', 'isnull', 'in', and 'range'. The "bar_code" field has 'exact' and 'iexact' as filter options, while the "create_time" field has 'year', 'month', 'day', 'week_day', 'gt', 'gte', 'lt', 'lte', and 'range' as filter options.

**Note**: When using this Filter class, ensure that the model attribute is set to the appropriate model for which the filters are being defined. The fields attribute should contain a dictionary where each key represents a field of the model, and the corresponding value is a list of filter options available for that field.
### ClassDef Meta
**Meta**: The function of Meta is to define the model and its fields for the Filter class.

**attributes**: 
- model: Represents the model associated with the Meta class.
- fields: A dictionary that maps field names to a list of lookup types applicable to that field.

**Code Description**: 
The Meta class is used to specify metadata for the Filter class. It contains two attributes: 'model' which refers to the ListModel, and 'fields' which is a dictionary defining the fields and their corresponding lookup types. In this case, the 'fields' attribute specifies the lookup types available for the "id", "bar_code", and "create_time" fields.

**Note**: 
Developers can use the Meta class to customize the behavior of the Filter class by defining the model and specifying the lookup types for each field. This allows for more flexibility and control over how filtering operations are performed within the Filter class.
