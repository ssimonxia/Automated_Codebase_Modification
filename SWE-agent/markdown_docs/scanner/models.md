## ClassDef ListModel
**ListModel**: The function of ListModel is to represent a model that stores information related to requests, including request mode, request code, bar code, openid, create time, and update time.

**attributes**: 
- mode: a CharField to store the request mode with a maximum length of 255 characters.
- code: a TextField to store the request code.
- bar_code: a CharField to store the bar code with a maximum length of 255 characters.
- openid: a CharField to store the openid with a maximum length of 255 characters.
- create_time: a DateTimeField that automatically records the creation time of the entry.
- update_time: a DateTimeField that automatically updates the time when the entry is modified.

**Code Description**: 
The ListModel class is a Django model that inherits from models.Model. It defines fields to store various information related to requests. The 'Meta' class inside ListModel specifies metadata such as the database table name, verbose names for better readability, and the default ordering of records by id in descending order.

**Note**: 
Developers can use ListModel to create instances that represent request information in the database. When querying or manipulating request data, they can leverage the attributes defined in ListModel to access and modify specific fields. In the project, the ListModel class might be utilized by other components such as views or serializers to interact with request data stored in the database.
### ClassDef Meta
**Meta**: The function of Meta is to define metadata options for the ListModel class.

**attributes**:
- db_table: Specifies the database table name for the ListModel class as 'scanner'.
- verbose_name: Sets a human-readable name for the ListModel class as 'Scanner'.
- verbose_name_plural: Provides a plural name for the ListModel class as 'Scanner'.
- ordering: Defines the default ordering of objects retrieved from the database as descending by 'id'.

**Code Description**:
The Meta class within the ListModel class in models.py file is used to specify metadata options for the ListModel class. 
- The db_table attribute is set to 'scanner', which indicates the name of the database table associated with the ListModel class.
- verbose_name is assigned as 'Scanner', serving as a human-readable name for the ListModel class.
- verbose_name_plural is defined as "Scanner" to provide a plural name for the ListModel class.
- The ordering attribute is configured with ['-id'], ensuring that objects retrieved from the database are ordered in descending order based on the 'id' field.

**Note**: Developers can customize the metadata options for the ListModel class by modifying the attributes within the Meta class according to their specific requirements.
