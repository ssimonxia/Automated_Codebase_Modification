## ClassDef Migration
**Migration**: The function of Migration is to define a database migration operation for creating a new model named 'ListModel' with specific fields and options.

**attributes**: 
- initial: A boolean attribute set to True indicating that this migration is the initial one.
- dependencies: A list of dependencies for this migration operation, which is empty in this case.
- operations: A list containing a single operation to create a new model 'ListModel' with defined fields and options.

**Code Description**:
The Migration class inherits from migrations.Migration and defines the database migration operation to create a new model 'ListModel'. The 'ListModel' model includes fields such as 'id', 'goods_shape', 'creater', 'openid', 'is_delete', 'create_time', and 'update_time'. Each field has specific characteristics like field type, max length, default values, and verbose names. The model also has options like verbose names, table name, ordering, etc., to customize the behavior of the model in the database.

**Note**: 
Developers can customize the model fields, options, and behavior by modifying the operations list in the Migration class. It is essential to understand the Django migration system and model definition to effectively use and modify database migrations in Django projects.
