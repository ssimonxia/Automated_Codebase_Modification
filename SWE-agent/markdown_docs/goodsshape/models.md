## ClassDef ListModel
**ListModel**: The function of ListModel is to define a model that represents a list of goods shapes with various attributes such as the shape of the goods, creator information, timestamps, and deletion status.

**attributes**:
- goods_shape: A character field representing the shape of the goods.
- creater: A character field indicating who created the goods shape.
- openid: A character field storing the openid related to the goods shape.
- is_delete: A boolean field to label if the goods shape is deleted.
- create_time: A DateTime field capturing the creation time of the goods shape.
- update_time: A DateTime field recording the last update time of the goods shape.

**Code Description**:
The ListModel class is a Django model that inherits from the models.Model class. It defines various fields to store information about goods shapes, including the shape itself, creator details, timestamps, and deletion status. The class also includes a Meta inner class that specifies metadata such as the database table name, verbose names, and default ordering based on the goods_shape field.

In the project, the ListModel class is utilized in the goodsshape/filter.py file within the Filter/Meta class. Here, the ListModel is set as the model for the filter, and specific lookup types are defined for filtering based on different fields of the ListModel.

Additionally, the ListModel class is referenced in the serializers.py file through multiple serializer classes: GoodsshapeGetSerializer, GoodsshapePostSerializer, GoodsshapeUpdateSerializer, and GoodsshapePartialUpdateSerializer. Each serializer class specifies the model as ListModel and configures the fields to be excluded or set as read-only during serialization.

Moreover, the ListModel class is used in the views.py file within the APIViewSet class methods. The get_queryset method filters ListModel instances based on the request user and project ID, while the create method creates a new ListModel instance after validating and saving the provided data.

**Note**:
Developers can use the ListModel class to represent and manage goods shapes in the application, ensuring structured storage and retrieval of relevant information. When working with ListModel instances, consider the defined attributes and their purposes to maintain data integrity and consistency within the system.
### ClassDef Meta
**Meta**: The function of Meta is to define metadata options for the ListModel class.

**attributes**:
- db_table: Specifies the database table name for the ListModel class as 'goodsshape'.
- verbose_name: Sets a human-readable name for the ListModel class as 'Goods Shape'.
- verbose_name_plural: Provides a plural name for the ListModel class as 'Goods Shape'.
- ordering: Defines the default ordering of query results based on the 'goods_shape' field.

**Code Description**:
The Meta class in the ListModel class is used to configure metadata options for the model. In this specific implementation, the db_table attribute is set to 'goodsshape', which determines the database table name associated with the ListModel class. The verbose_name attribute is assigned the value 'Goods Shape', serving as a human-readable name for the model. Additionally, verbose_name_plural is set to 'Goods Shape' to provide a plural name for the model. The ordering attribute specifies the default ordering of query results based on the 'goods_shape' field.

**Note**:
Developers can customize the Meta class in Django models to define various metadata options for the model. These options help in configuring the behavior of the model in the database and admin interface.
