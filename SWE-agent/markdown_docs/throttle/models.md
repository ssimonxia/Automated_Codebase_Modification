## ClassDef ListModel
**ListModel**: The function of ListModel is to define a model with fields representing various attributes related to throttling, such as openid, appid, ip, method, t_code, and create_time.

**attributes**: 
- openid: CharField with a max length of 255 characters, representing the Openid.
- appid: CharField with a max length of 255 characters, representing the Appid.
- ip: CharField with a max length of 255 characters, representing the IP address.
- method: CharField with a max length of 18 characters, representing the method used.
- t_code: CharField with a max length of 255 characters, representing the Transaction Code.
- create_time: DateTimeField set to auto_now_add, representing the time of creation.

**Code Description**: 
The ListModel class is a model in the throttle application that inherits from the models.Model class provided by Django. It defines various fields to store information related to throttling, such as the user's Openid, Appid, IP address, method, transaction code, and the creation time of the entry. Additionally, the class Meta within the ListModel specifies metadata including the database table name, verbose names for better readability in the Django admin interface, and the default ordering based on the 'id' field in descending order.

**Note**: 
Developers can use the ListModel class to create instances that store throttling-related data in the database. When interacting with instances of ListModel, they can access and manipulate the defined attributes like openid, appid, ip, method, t_code, and create_time. The metadata specified in the class Meta can be utilized to customize the behavior of ListModel in the Django admin interface and database operations.
### ClassDef Meta
**Meta**: The function of Meta is to define metadata options for the ListModel class.

**attributes**:
- db_table: Specifies the database table name for the model.
- verbose_name: Sets a human-readable name for the model.
- verbose_name_plural: Sets a human-readable plural name for the model.
- ordering: Defines the default ordering for queries on the model.

**Code Description**:
The Meta class in the ListModel class is used to provide metadata options for the model. In this specific implementation, the `db_table` attribute is set to 'throttle', indicating the database table name for the model is 'throttle'. The `verbose_name` attribute is set to 'Throttle', which provides a human-readable name for the model. The `verbose_name_plural` attribute is set to "Throttle", which gives a human-readable plural name for the model. Lastly, the `ordering` attribute is set to ['-id'], specifying the default ordering for queries on the model to be in descending order based on the 'id' field.

**Note**:
Developers can customize the metadata options in the Meta class to tailor the behavior of the ListModel class according to their specific requirements.
