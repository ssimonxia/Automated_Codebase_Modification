## ClassDef Filter
**Filter**: The function of Filter is to define filter options for the ListModel.

**attributes**: 
- model: Specifies the model to be filtered (ListModel in this case).
- fields: Defines the fields along with their lookup types for filtering.

**Code Description**:
The Filter class is a subclass of FilterSet and is used to specify filtering options for the ListModel. The Meta inner class is used to define metadata options for the Filter class. In this case, the model attribute is set to ListModel, indicating that the filtering will be applied to the ListModel. The fields attribute is a dictionary where each key represents a field in the ListModel, and the corresponding value is a list of lookup types that can be used for filtering that field. 

For example, the "id" field can be filtered using lookup types such as 'exact', 'iexact', 'gt', 'gte', 'lt', 'lte', 'isnull', 'in', and 'range'. Similarly, other fields like "goods_specs", "creater", "is_delete", "create_time", and "update_time" have their own set of allowed lookup types for filtering.

**Note**: When using the Filter class, ensure that the model attribute is set to the appropriate model, and define the fields along with their respective lookup types for accurate filtering of data.
### ClassDef Meta
**Meta**: The function of Meta is to define metadata options for the Filter class.

**attributes**: 
- model: Represents the model to be used for filtering.
- fields: Contains a dictionary where each key represents a field name and the corresponding value is a list of lookup types that can be used for filtering that field.

**Code Description**:
The Meta class in the Filter class is used to specify metadata options. In this specific implementation, the Meta class defines the model attribute as ListModel and the fields attribute as a dictionary containing various field names along with the corresponding lookup types that can be used for filtering those fields. This allows for customization and configuration of how the Filter class interacts with the specified model and its fields during the filtering process.

**Note**: Developers can leverage the Meta class to fine-tune the behavior of the Filter class by specifying the model and defining the available lookup types for each field, enabling more precise and tailored data filtering operations.
