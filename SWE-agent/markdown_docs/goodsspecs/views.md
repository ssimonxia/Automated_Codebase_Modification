### FunctionDef get_project(self)
**get_project**: The function of get_project is to retrieve the 'pk' value from the kwargs attribute of the object and return it.

**parameters**:
- self: The reference to the current instance of the class.

**Code Description**:
The get_project function attempts to retrieve the 'pk' value from the kwargs attribute of the object. If successful, it returns the 'pk' value; otherwise, it returns None.

In the calling object get_queryset, the get_project function is utilized to obtain the 'id' value, which is then used to filter ListModel objects based on certain conditions related to the request user and 'id'.

**Note**:
- This function is designed to handle exceptions by returning None if the 'pk' value cannot be retrieved.
- It is essential to ensure that the 'pk' value is correctly passed to this function to avoid potential errors.

**Output Example**:
If the 'pk' value is successfully retrieved, the function may return an integer representing the 'id' value.

### FunctionDef get_queryset(self)
**get_queryset**: The function of get_queryset is to filter ListModel objects based on specific conditions related to the request user and 'id'.

**parameters**:
- self: The reference to the current instance of the class.

**Code Description**:
The get_queryset function first calls the get_project function to retrieve the 'id' value. It then checks if the request user exists. If the user exists, it further checks if the 'id' is None. Based on these conditions, the function filters ListModel objects accordingly and returns the filtered queryset.

The function filters ListModel objects based on the following conditions:
- If the 'id' is None, it filters objects where 'openid' matches the request authorization 'openid' and 'is_delete' is False.
- If the 'id' is not None, it filters objects where 'openid' matches the request authorization 'openid', 'id' matches the retrieved 'id', and 'is_delete' is False.
- If the request user does not exist, the function returns an empty queryset using ListModel.objects.none().

**Note**:
- The get_queryset function relies on the get_project function to retrieve the 'id' value, which is crucial for filtering ListModel objects accurately.
- Ensure that the 'id' value is correctly obtained to avoid unexpected behavior in the queryset filtering process.

**Output Example**:
If the conditions are met, the function may return a filtered queryset of ListModel objects based on the specified criteria.

### FunctionDef get_serializer_class(self)
**get_serializer_class**: The function of get_serializer_class is to determine and return the appropriate serializer class based on the action performed.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.

**Code Description**:
The get_serializer_class function contains conditional statements to select the serializer class based on the action being performed. If the action is 'list', 'retrieve', or 'destroy', it returns GoodsspecsGetSerializer. If the action is 'create', it returns GoodsspecsPostSerializer. If the action is 'update', it returns GoodsspecsUpdateSerializer. If the action is 'partial_update', it returns GoodsspecsPartialUpdateSerializer. Otherwise, it calls the http_method_not_allowed method.

This function is crucial in determining the appropriate serializer class to handle serialization based on the specific action being executed within the APIViewSet class.

**Note**:
Developers should ensure that the actions defined in this function align with the corresponding serializer classes to handle data serialization effectively.

**Output Example**:
```python
return serializers.GoodsspecsGetSerializer
```
***
### FunctionDef create(self, request)
**create**: The function of create is to handle the creation of a new object based on the provided data.

**parameters**:
- request: The HTTP request object.
- *args: Additional positional arguments.
- **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments.

**Code Description**:
The create function first retrieves the data from the request object and adds the 'openid' value from the authentication information. It then checks if an object with the same 'openid' and 'goods_specs' exists in the ListModel. If the object exists, it raises an APIException with a message indicating that the data already exists. If the object does not exist, it proceeds to serialize the data, validate it, save it, and return a response with the serialized data and a success status code along with the appropriate headers.

**Note**:
- This function assumes the existence of a ListModel for data storage and retrieval.
- The function relies on the presence of a serializer for data manipulation and validation.
- The function utilizes the request object to access data and authentication information.

**Output Example**:
```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "goods_specs": "example_specs",
    "other_field": "value",
    "created_at": "2022-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2022-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

### FunctionDef update(self, request, pk)
**update**: The function of update is to update a specific object instance.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.
- request: The request object.
- pk: The primary key of the object to be updated.

**Code Description**:
The update function first retrieves the object instance using the get_object method. It then checks if the openid of the object matches the openid of the authenticated request. If they do not match, an APIException is raised with a message indicating that the data cannot be updated as it does not belong to the requester. If the openids match, the function proceeds to update the object with the data provided in the request. It validates the serializer with the provided data, saves the serializer, retrieves success headers, and returns a response with the updated data and a status code of 200.

**Note**:
- This function assumes the presence of a get_object method, a get_serializer method, and a get_success_headers method within the class.
- The function relies on the request object and the request data for updating the object instance.

**Output Example**:
```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Updated Name",
    "description": "Updated Description"
}
```
***
### FunctionDef partial_update(self, request, pk)
**partial_update**: The function of partial_update is to partially update an object based on the provided data.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.
- request: The request object containing metadata about the request.
- pk: The primary key of the object to be updated.

**Code Description**:
The partial_update function first retrieves the object to be updated using the get_object method. It then checks if the openid of the object matches the openid of the authenticated user. If they do not match, an APIException is raised. If the openids match, the function proceeds to update the object with the provided data. The data is retrieved from the request object, and a serializer is used to validate and save the updated data. Finally, the function returns a response with the updated data and a success status code along with the appropriate headers.

**Note**:
It is important to ensure that the authentication mechanism is in place to prevent unauthorized updates to objects.

**Output Example**:
{
    "field1": "updated_value1",
    "field2": "updated_value2",
    ...
}
***
### FunctionDef destroy(self, request, pk)
**destroy**: The function of destroy is to delete a specific object after checking if the request is made by the owner of the object.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.
- request: The request object containing metadata about the request.
- pk: The primary key of the object to be deleted.

**Code Description**:
The destroy function first retrieves the object to be deleted using the get_object method. It then checks if the openid of the object matches the openid of the authenticated user making the request. If they do not match, an APIException is raised with a message indicating that the data cannot be deleted as it does not belong to the requester. If the openids match, the is_delete field of the object is set to True, and the object is saved. The function then serializes the updated object, retrieves the success headers, and returns a response with the serialized data and a status code of 200.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure proper authentication and authorization mechanisms are in place to prevent unauthorized deletion of data.

**Output Example**:
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Example Object",
    "is_delete": true
}
