## ClassDef ListModel
**ListModel**: The function of ListModel is to represent a model that stores information about goods specifications, including the creator, openid, deletion status, creation time, and update time.

**attributes**: 
- goods_specs: A CharField to store the goods specifications.
- creater: A CharField to store the creator of the goods specifications.
- openid: A CharField to store the openid related to the goods specifications.
- is_delete: A BooleanField to indicate the deletion status of the goods specifications.
- create_time: A DateTimeField to store the creation time of the goods specifications.
- update_time: A DateTimeField to store the last update time of the goods specifications.

**Code Description**: 
The ListModel class defines a model in Django that represents goods specifications. It contains fields to store information such as goods_specs, creater, openid, deletion status, creation time, and update time. The Meta class within ListModel specifies the database table name, verbose names for better readability, and the default ordering based on the goods_specs field.

**Note**: 
Developers can use ListModel to create, retrieve, update, and delete instances of goods specifications in the database. The verbose_name and verbose_name_plural attributes can be utilized for better human-readable representation in the Django admin interface. The ordering attribute helps in defining the default sorting order when querying instances of ListModel.
### ClassDef Meta
**Meta**: The function of Meta is to define metadata options for the ListModel class.

**attributes**:
- db_table: Specifies the database table name for the model.
- verbose_name: Sets a human-readable name for the model.
- verbose_name_plural: Sets a human-readable plural name for the model.
- ordering: Defines the default ordering for query sets of the model.

**Code Description**:
The Meta class in the ListModel class is used to provide metadata options for the model. In this specific implementation:
- The db_table attribute is set to 'goodsspecs', indicating the name of the database table associated with the ListModel.
- The verbose_name attribute is assigned the value 'Goods Specs', which represents a human-readable name for the model.
- The verbose_name_plural attribute is set to "Goods Specs", providing a human-readable plural name for the model.
- The ordering attribute is defined as ['goods_specs'], specifying the default ordering of query sets based on the 'goods_specs' field.

**Note**:
Developers can customize the behavior of the ListModel class by modifying the attributes within the Meta class to suit their specific requirements.
