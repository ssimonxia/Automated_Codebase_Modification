## ClassDef StockListFilter
**StockListFilter**: The function of StockListFilter is to define filter options for the StockListModel data based on specific fields.

**attributes**:
- model: StockListModel
- fields: A dictionary specifying the filter options for various fields in the StockListModel.

**Code Description**:
The StockListFilter class is a part of the Django Filter package and is used to create filters for the StockListModel data. It defines the filter options for different fields such as id, goods_code, goods_desc, goods_qty, and various stock-related fields like onhand_stock, can_order_stock, ordered_stock, and more. The Meta class inside StockListFilter specifies the model to be filtered (StockListModel) and the filter options for each field using a dictionary format.

In the project, the StockListFilter class is utilized in the StockListViewSet and FileListDownloadView classes in the stock/views.py file. Both classes set the filter_class attribute to StockListFilter, enabling them to filter StockListModel data based on the defined options in StockListFilter. This allows for efficient data filtering and retrieval based on specific criteria defined in the StockListFilter class.

**Note**:
Developers can customize the filter options for different fields in the StockListModel by modifying the fields dictionary inside the StockListFilter class. This provides flexibility in filtering data based on specific requirements in the project.
### ClassDef Meta
**Meta**: The function of Meta is to define metadata options for the StockListFilter class, specifying the model to be used and filter fields for querying.

**attributes**:
- model: Represents the StockListModel class for filtering.
- fields: Contains a dictionary with filter fields and their lookup types for querying stock data.

**Code Description**:
The Meta class within the StockListFilter class provides metadata options for configuring how data is filtered. It references the StockListModel class as the model to be used for filtering. The fields attribute is a dictionary that defines the filter fields available for querying stock data along with their respective lookup types. These fields enable precise filtering of stock information based on various criteria such as goods code, quantities, timestamps, and supplier details.

The Meta class plays a crucial role in defining the behavior of the StockListFilter class by specifying the model and filter fields, allowing developers to customize and optimize the querying process for stock data efficiently.

**Note**:
Developers can leverage the Meta class in the StockListFilter to tailor the filtering behavior according to specific requirements, ensuring accurate and targeted retrieval of stock information based on the defined filter fields and lookup types.

## ClassDef StockBinFilter
**StockBinFilter**: The function of StockBinFilter is to define the filter options for the StockBinModel objects.

**attributes**:
- model: The model class that the filter is applied to.
- fields: A dictionary that defines the filter options for each field of the model.

**Code Description**:
The StockBinFilter class is a subclass of the FilterSet class, which is used to define the filter options for the StockBinModel objects. It specifies the model class as StockBinModel and defines the filter options for each field of the model.

The filter options are defined in the fields attribute, which is a dictionary. Each key in the dictionary represents a field of the model, and the corresponding value is a list of filter options for that field. The available filter options include 'exact', 'iexact', 'gt', 'gte', 'lt', 'lte', 'isnull', 'in', 'range', 'contains', and 'icontains'. These filter options allow users to filter the StockBinModel objects based on different conditions, such as exact match, case-insensitive exact match, greater than, greater than or equal to, less than, less than or equal to, null value, list of values, range of values, and substring match.

The StockBinFilter class is used as the filter_class attribute in the StockBinViewSet class, which is a viewset for the StockBinModel objects. This means that the filter options defined in the StockBinFilter class will be applied when filtering the StockBinModel objects in the StockBinViewSet class.

**Note**:
- The StockBinFilter class provides a convenient way to define filter options for the StockBinModel objects.
- The filter options defined in the StockBinFilter class can be customized according to the specific requirements of the project.
- The StockBinFilter class is used in conjunction with the StockBinViewSet class to provide filtering functionality for the StockBinModel objects in the project.
### ClassDef Meta
**Meta**: The function of Meta is to define metadata options for the StockBinModel class.

**Attributes**:
- model: StockBinModel
- fields: A dictionary containing field names as keys and a list of lookup types as values.

**Code Description**:
The Meta class within the StockBinFilter class defines metadata options for the StockBinModel class. It specifies the model attribute as StockBinModel, indicating the model associated with this metadata. Additionally, the fields attribute is a dictionary that maps field names to a list of lookup types that can be used for filtering data related to those fields.

The Meta class plays a crucial role in configuring how the StockBinFilter class interacts with the StockBinModel. By defining the model attribute, it establishes the link between the filter class and the model class, enabling the filter to work with the specified model's data. The fields attribute provides a structured way to specify which fields and lookup types are available for filtering operations within the filter.

In the project hierarchy, the Meta class is directly related to the StockBinModel class, as it defines metadata options specifically for this model. This relationship ensures that the StockBinFilter class can effectively filter and query data from the StockBinModel based on the specified fields and lookup types.

**Note**: The Meta class is essential for configuring metadata options within the StockBinFilter class, allowing for efficient data filtering and querying operations on the StockBinModel class. Developers can leverage the Meta class to customize how the filter interacts with the model's data, enhancing the flexibility and functionality of the filtering process.
