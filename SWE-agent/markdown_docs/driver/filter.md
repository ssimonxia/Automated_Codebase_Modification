## ClassDef Filter
**Filter**: The function of Filter is to define filter options for the ListModel model based on specific fields.

**attributes**:
- model: ListModel
- fields: A dictionary containing field names as keys and a list of filter options as values.

**Code Description**:
The Filter class is a subclass of FilterSet and is used to specify filtering options for the ListModel model. It contains a Meta class where the model attribute is set to ListModel, indicating the model to be filtered. The fields attribute is a dictionary that maps field names to a list of filter options available for each field.

In the project, the Filter class is utilized in the APIViewSet and FileDownloadView classes in the views.py file. Both classes set the filter_class attribute to Filter, indicating that the filtering options defined in the Filter class should be applied when filtering data.

The Filter class provides a structured way to define filtering options for the ListModel model, allowing developers to easily filter data based on specific criteria defined for each field.

**Note**: Developers can customize the filter options for each field in the ListModel model by modifying the fields attribute in the Filter class.
### ClassDef Meta
**Meta**: The function of Meta is to define the metadata options for the Filter class.

**attributes**: 
- model: Represents the model to be used for the filter.
- fields: Contains a dictionary where each key represents a field name and the corresponding value is a list of lookup types that can be used for filtering that field.

**Code Description**:
The Meta class in the Filter class is used to specify metadata options. It contains two attributes:
1. **model**: This attribute specifies the model (ListModel in this case) to be used for the filter operations.
2. **fields**: This attribute is a dictionary where each key represents a field name in the model, and the corresponding value is a list of lookup types that can be used for filtering that specific field. For example, for the "id" field, lookup types such as 'exact', 'iexact', 'gt', 'gte', 'lt', 'lte', 'isnull', 'in', and 'range' are available for filtering.

**Note**: Developers can utilize the Meta class to customize the behavior of the Filter class by defining the model and specifying the filtering options for different fields within that model.

## ClassDef DispatchFilter
**DispatchFilter**: The function of DispatchFilter is to define filter options for the DispatchListModel model.

**attributes**:
- model: DispatchListModel
- fields: Dictionary containing filter options for different fields of the DispatchListModel model.

**Code Description**:
The DispatchFilter class is a part of the DispatchFilterSet class and is used to specify filter options for the DispatchListModel model. It defines various filter options for fields such as "id", "driver_name", "dn_code", "contact", "creater", "create_time", and "update_time". Each field has specific filter types such as 'exact', 'iexact', 'contains', 'icontains', 'gt', 'gte', 'lt', 'lte', 'isnull', 'in', 'range', 'year', 'month', 'day', and 'week_day'.

In the project, the DispatchFilter class is utilized as the filter_class attribute in the DispatchListViewSet class in the views.py file. This association allows the DispatchListViewSet class to apply the defined filter options when querying the DispatchListModel model. The DispatchFilter class plays a crucial role in filtering data based on specified criteria, enhancing the functionality of the API endpoints related to dispatch lists.

**Note**:
Developers can customize the filter options for the DispatchListModel model by modifying the fields dictionary within the DispatchFilter class according to their specific requirements.
### ClassDef Meta
**Meta**: The function of Meta is to define metadata settings for the DispatchListModel class.

**attributes**:
- model: DispatchListModel
- fields: A dictionary containing field names as keys and corresponding lookup types as values.

**Code Description**:
The Meta class within the DispatchFilter module defines metadata settings for the DispatchListModel class. It specifies the model attribute as DispatchListModel, indicating the model associated with this metadata. Additionally, the fields attribute is a dictionary that maps field names to a list of lookup types that can be used for filtering data related to the DispatchListModel.

The Meta class plays a crucial role in configuring how the DispatchListModel class interacts with the database and how data filtering operations are performed based on the specified fields and lookup types. By defining the model and fields attributes within the Meta class, developers can customize the behavior of the DispatchListModel class when querying and filtering dispatch list data.

In the project structure, the Meta class is nested within the DispatchFilter module, which is utilized for filtering dispatch list data based on specific criteria defined in the fields attribute. This metadata configuration enhances the flexibility and efficiency of querying dispatch list records using the DispatchListModel class.

**Note**:
Developers can leverage the Meta class in the DispatchFilter module to fine-tune the behavior of the DispatchListModel class when filtering dispatch list data. By customizing the fields and lookup types, developers can tailor data retrieval operations to meet specific requirements within the application.
