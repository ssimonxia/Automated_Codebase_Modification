## ClassDef ListModel
**ListModel**: The function of ListModel is to define a model for storing driver information including driver name, license plate, contact number, creator, openid, deletion status, creation time, and update time.

**attributes**:
- driver_name: A CharField to store the name of the driver.
- license_plate: A CharField to store the license plate of the driver.
- contact: A CharField to store the contact number of the driver.
- creater: A CharField to store the name of the creator of the driver entry.
- openid: A CharField to store the openid of the driver.
- is_delete: A BooleanField to indicate the deletion status of the driver entry.
- create_time: A DateTimeField to store the creation time of the driver entry.
- update_time: A DateTimeField to store the last update time of the driver entry.

**Code Description**:
The ListModel class is a model in Django that inherits from models.Model. It defines various fields to store information about drivers, such as their name, license plate, contact number, creator, openid, deletion status, creation time, and update time. The Meta class within ListModel specifies metadata including the database table name, verbose names for better readability in the admin interface, and the default ordering based on the driver's name.

**Note**:
Developers can use the ListModel class to create instances of drivers in the system and store their relevant information. The class provides a structured way to manage and retrieve driver details within the Django application.
### ClassDef Meta
**Meta**: The function of Meta is to define metadata options for the ListModel class.

**attributes**:
- db_table: Specifies the database table name for the model.
- verbose_name: Sets a human-readable name for the model.
- verbose_name_plural: Sets a human-readable plural name for the model.
- ordering: Defines the default ordering for query sets of the model.

**Code Description**:
The Meta class in the ListModel class is used to provide metadata options for the model. In this specific implementation, the following attributes are defined:
- db_table: It is set to 'driver', indicating the database table name for the model is 'driver'.
- verbose_name: The value is 'Driver', which represents a human-readable name for the model as 'Driver'.
- verbose_name_plural: The value is "Driver", which represents a human-readable plural name for the model as "Driver".
- ordering: The attribute is set to ['driver_name'], specifying the default ordering for query sets of the model based on the 'driver_name' field.

**Note**:
Developers can customize the behavior of the ListModel class by modifying the attributes within the Meta class according to their specific requirements.

## ClassDef DispatchListModel
**DispatchListModel**: The function of DispatchListModel is to define a model representing a dispatch list with specific fields and metadata settings.

**attributes**:
- driver_name: a CharField to store the name of the driver.
- dn_code: a CharField to store the DN code.
- contact: a BigIntegerField to store the contact number.
- creater: a CharField to store the creator's name.
- openid: a CharField to store the Openid.
- create_time: a DateTimeField to store the creation time.
- update_time: a DateTimeField to store the update time.

**Code Description**:
The DispatchListModel class is a model that inherits from the models.Model class in Django. It defines various fields such as driver_name, dn_code, contact, creater, openid, create_time, and update_time using different field types provided by Django's models module. The class also includes a Meta inner class that specifies metadata for the model, including the database table name, verbose names, and default ordering based on the create_time field in descending order.

This model represents a dispatch list entity in the system with attributes related to driver information, contact details, creation details, and timestamps for record keeping. The model is designed to interact with the database to store and retrieve dispatch list data efficiently.

In the project, the DispatchListModel is utilized by other components such as DispatchFilter and DispatchListGetSerializer to filter and serialize data related to dispatch lists. Additionally, in the DispatchListViewSet class, the get_queryset method uses DispatchListModel to retrieve specific dispatch list objects based on certain conditions, including the authenticated user's openid and the provided id.

**Note**:
Developers can use the DispatchListModel class to create, update, retrieve, and delete dispatch list records in the system. It is essential to understand the field types and metadata settings defined in the model to effectively work with dispatch list data in the application.
### ClassDef Meta
**Meta**: The function of Meta is to define metadata options for the DispatchListModel class.

**attributes**: 
- db_table: Specifies the database table name for the model.
- verbose_name: Sets a human-readable name for the model.
- verbose_name_plural: Sets a human-readable plural name for the model.
- ordering: Specifies the default ordering for query sets of this model.

**Code Description**: 
The Meta class in the DispatchListModel defines metadata options for the model. 
- The db_table attribute is set to 'dispatchlist', indicating the name of the database table associated with the model.
- The verbose_name attribute is set to 'Dispatch List', providing a human-readable name for the model.
- The verbose_name_plural attribute is set to "Dispatch List", which is the plural form of the verbose_name.
- The ordering attribute is set to ['-create_time'], indicating that query sets of this model should be ordered by the 'create_time' field in descending order by default.

**Note**: 
Developers can customize the behavior of the DispatchListModel class by modifying the attributes of the Meta class according to their specific requirements.
