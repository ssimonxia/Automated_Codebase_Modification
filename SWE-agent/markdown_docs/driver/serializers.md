## ClassDef DriverGetSerializer
**DriverGetSerializer**: The function of DriverGetSerializer is to serialize the data related to a driver with specific fields and configurations.

**attributes**:
- driver_name: A read-only field for the driver's name.
- license_plate: A read-only field for the driver's license plate.
- contact: A read-only field for the driver's contact information.
- create_time: A read-only field for the creation time of the driver entry.
- update_time: A read-only field for the last update time of the driver entry.

**Code Description**:
The `DriverGetSerializer` class is a subclass of `serializers.ModelSerializer` that defines the serialization behavior for driver data. It includes specific fields such as `driver_name`, `license_plate`, `contact`, `create_time`, and `update_time`, all set as read-only and not required for input. The `create_time` and `update_time` fields are formatted to display the date and time in the '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S' format.

In the `Meta` class, the model is set to `ListModel`, and certain fields like 'openid', 'is_delete' are excluded from serialization. The 'id' field is marked as read-only.

This serializer is used to transform driver data into a format that can be easily rendered into JSON or other content types for API responses. It ensures that only specific fields are included, and the data is presented in a structured way.

**Note**:
Developers can use `DriverGetSerializer` in views or API endpoints where they need to retrieve driver data in a specific format. The serializer helps in maintaining consistency and readability of the data returned to clients.
