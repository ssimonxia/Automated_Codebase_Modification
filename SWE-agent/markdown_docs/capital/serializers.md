## ClassDef CapitalGetSerializer
**CapitalGetSerializer**: The function of CapitalGetSerializer is to serialize the data related to capital information with specific fields and configurations.

**attributes**:
- capital_name: CharField with read-only and not required properties.
- capital_qty: IntegerField with read-only and not required properties.
- capital_cost: FloatField with read-only and not required properties.
- creater: CharField with read-only and not required properties.
- create_time: DateTimeField with read-only property and a specific date-time format.
- update_time: DateTimeField with read-only property and a specific date-time format.

**Code Description**:
The `CapitalGetSerializer` class is a subclass of `serializers.ModelSerializer` that defines the serialization behavior for capital-related data. It includes fields such as `capital_name`, `capital_qty`, `capital_cost`, `creater`, `create_time`, and `update_time`, each with specific configurations like read-only and not required properties. The `Meta` class inside `CapitalGetSerializer` specifies the model to be used and excludes certain fields like 'openid' and 'is_delete' from serialization. Additionally, it sets 'id' and 'openid' fields as read-only.

In the project, this serializer is called by the `get_serializer_class` method in the `capital/views.py` file. Depending on the action (list, retrieve, destroy, create, update, partial_update), different serializers (`CapitalGetSerializer`, `CapitalPostSerializer`, `CapitalUpdateSerializer`, `CapitalPartialUpdateSerializer`) are returned. This ensures that the appropriate serializer is used based on the action performed.

**Note**:
Developers using this serializer should be aware of the specific field configurations and the model it is associated with. Ensure that the correct serializer is returned based on the action to maintain data consistency and integrity in the application.
### ClassDef Meta
**Meta**: The function of Meta is to define metadata options for the CapitalGetSerializer class.

**attributes**:
