## ClassDef Migration
**Migration**: The function of Migration is to create a database migration for the Capital model.

**attributes**: 
- initial: A boolean attribute set to True indicating that this is the initial migration.
- dependencies: A list of dependencies for the migration. Currently empty in this case.
- operations: A list of database operations to be applied during the migration process. In this case, it includes creating a new model called ListModel with specified fields and options.

**Code Description**:
The Migration class inherits from migrations.Migration and defines the initial attribute as True. It specifies the dependencies as an empty list and includes operations to create a new model ListModel. The ListModel consists of fields such as id, capital_name, capital_qty, capital_cost, creater, openid, is_delete, create_time, and update_time. These fields define the structure of the Capital model in the database with their respective data types and options. Additionally, options for the model such as verbose_name, verbose_name_plural, db_table, and ordering are provided to customize the behavior of the model in the database.

**Note**: Developers can customize the fields and options of the ListModel as needed to reflect the specific requirements of the Capital model in the database.
