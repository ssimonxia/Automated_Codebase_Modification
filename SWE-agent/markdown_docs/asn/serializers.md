**Code Description**:
The FileDetailRenderSerializer class is a ModelSerializer that defines the structure of the data serialization for file detail rendering. It includes various fields such as asn_code, asn_status, goods_code, goods_desc, goods_qty, and others to represent the attributes of file details. The class Meta inside the serializer specifies the model to be used, which is AsnDetailModel, and excludes certain fields like openid, is_delete from serialization.

This serializer is utilized in the FileDetailDownloadView class within the asn/views.py file. In the FileDetailDownloadView class, the get_serializer_class method determines the serializer class based on the action, returning FileDetailRenderSerializer for the 'list' action. The list method generates a CSV response by serializing the queryset data using FileDetailRenderSerializer and rendering it based on the requested language before returning it as a downloadable file with a timestamped filename.

**Note**:
Developers can use this serializer to handle the serialization and deserialization of file detail data for rendering purposes. Ensure to set the appropriate fields and configurations in the serializer for accurate data representation.
### ClassDef Meta
**Meta**: The function of Meta is to define metadata options for the AsnDetailModel class.

**Attributes**:
- model: Refers to the AsnDetailModel model.
- ref_name: Represents the reference name for the ASNFileDetailRenderSerializer.
- exclude: Specifies the fields to be excluded from serialization.

**Code Description**:
The Meta class within the AsnDetailModel class defines metadata options for the model. It specifies the model to be used, sets a reference name for the serializer, and excludes specific fields from serialization. In this case, the model attribute points to the AsnDetailModel model, ref_name is set to 'ASNFileDetailRenderSerializer', and exclude contains a list of fields ('openid', 'is_delete') to be excluded during serialization.

The Meta class plays a crucial role in configuring how the AsnDetailModel class is serialized and provides additional information about the model for serialization purposes. By defining these metadata options, developers can control how the model is represented in different contexts, such as when serializing data for API responses.

**Note**: When working with serializers and defining how models are serialized, developers can utilize the Meta class to customize serialization behavior and handle specific requirements for data representation. It is essential to understand the purpose of each Meta option and how it impacts the serialization process to ensure data is serialized correctly and efficiently.
