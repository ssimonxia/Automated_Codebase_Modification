## ClassDef GoodsunitGetSerializer
**GoodsunitGetSerializer**: The function of GoodsunitGetSerializer is to serialize the data related to goods units with specific read-only and formatting configurations.

**attributes**:
- goods_unit: CharField with read-only and not required settings.
- creater: CharField with read-only and not required settings.
- create_time: DateTimeField with read-only setting and custom date-time format.
- update_time: DateTimeField with read-only setting and custom date-time format.

**Code Description**:
The GoodsunitGetSerializer class is a ModelSerializer that specifies the serialization behavior for goods units data. It includes fields like goods_unit, creater, create_time, and update_time with specific configurations. The Meta class defines the model to be serialized, excludes certain fields like openid, is_delete, and sets the read-only field as id.

In the project, this serializer is called in the APIViewSet's get_serializer_class method. Depending on the action performed (list, retrieve, destroy, create, update, partial_update), different serializers are returned. For the specific actions related to retrieving goods units data, the GoodsunitGetSerializer is utilized to ensure the data is serialized correctly.

**Note**:
Developers can use this serializer to handle the serialization of goods units data in read-only mode with customized field settings. Make sure to assign the appropriate serializer based on the action being performed to ensure the correct serialization behavior.
### ClassDef Meta
**Meta**: The function of Meta is to define metadata options for the GoodsunitGetSerializer class.

**attributes**:
- model: ListModel
- exclude: ['openid', 'is_delete']
- read_only_fields: ['id']

**Code Description**:
The Meta class in the GoodsunitGetSerializer defines metadata options for the serializer. 
- The 'model' attribute specifies the model class to be used by the serializer, in this case, ListModel.
- The 'exclude' attribute lists the fields from the model that should be excluded from the serialization process, such as 'openid' and 'is_delete'.
- The 'read_only_fields' attribute specifies the fields that should be treated as read-only during deserialization, here, only 'id' is marked as read-only.

**Note**:
Developers can customize the behavior of the serializer by adjusting the attributes within the Meta class according to their specific requirements.

- goods_unit: A character field that is not read-only and required, validated using the data_validate function.
- creater: A character field that is not read-only and required, validated using the data_validate function.

**Code Description**:
The GoodsunitPostSerializer class extends the ModelSerializer class from the serializers module. It defines three fields: openid, goods_unit, and creater, each specifying its characteristics such as read-only status, requirement, and validation using specific functions from the datasolve module. The Meta class within GoodsunitPostSerializer specifies the model to be used, excludes the 'is_delete' field, and sets 'id' as a read-only field.

This serializer is utilized in various parts of the project where goods unit data needs to be serialized and validated, ensuring the integrity and correctness of the information being processed.

**Note**: GoodsunitPostSerializer plays a crucial role in handling the serialization and validation of goods unit data within the project. It ensures that the provided data meets the specified criteria before being processed further.
### ClassDef Meta
**Meta**: The function of Meta is to define metadata options for the GoodsunitPostSerializer class.

**attributes**:
- model: ListModel
- exclude: ['is_delete', ]
- read_only_fields: ['id', ]

**Code Description**:
The Meta class within the GoodsunitPostSerializer class is used to define metadata options for the serializer. In this case, the 'model' attribute is set to ListModel, indicating the model that the serializer should be based on. The 'exclude' attribute specifies that the 'is_delete' field should be excluded from the serialization process. Additionally, the 'read_only_fields' attribute specifies that the 'id' field should be treated as read-only during deserialization.

**Note**:
Developers can customize the behavior of the serializer by modifying the attributes within the Meta class according to their specific requirements.

## ClassDef GoodsunitUpdateSerializer
**GoodsunitUpdateSerializer**: The function of GoodsunitUpdateSerializer is to serialize and validate the data for updating goods units.

**attributes**:
- goods_unit: A character field that is required for updating goods units.
- creater: A character field that is required for specifying the creator of the goods unit.

**Code Description**:
The GoodsunitUpdateSerializer class is a part of the serializers module in the goodsunit application. It extends the ModelSerializer class provided by Django REST framework for serializing and validating data related to updating goods units. 

In this class, there are two fields defined:
1. goods_unit: This field is a character field that must be provided for updating goods units. It is set as read-only and required, with a custom validator "data_validate" from the datasolve module.
2. creater: Another character field that is required for specifying the creator of the goods unit. Similar to goods_unit, it is also set as read-only and required with the same custom validator.

Additionally, the Meta inner class is used to provide metadata for the serializer. It specifies the model to be used (ListModel), fields to be excluded ('openid', 'is_delete'), and fields that are read-only ('id', 'create_time', 'update_time') during the update process.

This serializer class plays a crucial role in ensuring that the data provided for updating goods units is validated according to the specified requirements before being processed further.

**Note**:
Developers using this serializer should ensure that the required fields (goods_unit and creater) are provided when updating goods units to avoid validation errors. The custom validator "data_validate" is applied to ensure the data meets specific criteria before being processed.
### ClassDef Meta
**Meta**: The function of Meta is to define metadata options for the GoodsunitUpdateSerializer class.

**attributes**: 
- model: Specifies the model that the serializer should be based on.
- exclude: Specifies which fields should be excluded from the serialization process.
- read_only_fields: Specifies which fields should be treated as read-only during deserialization.

**Code Description**:
The Meta class within the GoodsunitUpdateSerializer class is used to provide metadata options for the serializer. 
- The 'model' attribute is set to ListModel, indicating that the serializer should be based on the ListModel model.
- The 'exclude' attribute is a list containing the field names 'openid', 'is_delete', which specifies that these fields should be excluded from the serialization process.
- The 'read_only_fields' attribute is a list containing the field names 'id', 'create_time', 'update_time', which specifies that these fields should be treated as read-only during deserialization.

**Note**: 
Developers can customize the behavior of the serializer by modifying the attributes of the Meta class according to their specific requirements.

## ClassDef GoodsunitPartialUpdateSerializer
**GoodsunitPartialUpdateSerializer**: The function of GoodsunitPartialUpdateSerializer is to serialize and validate partial updates for the Goodsunit model.

**attributes**:
- goods_unit: A CharField that allows partial updates with read and write access.
- creater: A CharField that allows partial updates with read and write access.

**Code Description**:
The GoodsunitPartialUpdateSerializer class extends the ModelSerializer class from the serializers module. It defines two fields, goods_unit and creater, both of which are CharFields with read and write access. The class Meta inner class specifies the model to be serialized (ListModel) and excludes certain fields ('openid', 'is_delete') from serialization. Additionally, it sets specific fields ('id', 'create_time', 'update_time') as read-only.

This serializer is used in scenarios where partial updates need to be performed on Goodsunit instances. The data_validate function from datasolve module is used as a validator for the goods_unit and creater fields to ensure that the data does not contain potentially harmful content like scripts or select statements.

This serializer is called in the project by the APIViewSet class in the views module. In the get_serializer_class method of the APIViewSet class, the GoodsunitPartialUpdateSerializer is returned when the action is 'partial_update', indicating that this serializer is specifically used for handling partial updates of Goodsunit instances.

**Note**:
Developers using this serializer should be aware of the validation logic implemented in the data_validate function to prevent the storage of malicious data in the goods_unit and creater fields.
### ClassDef Meta
**Meta**: The function of Meta is to provide metadata for the GoodsunitPartialUpdateSerializer class.

**attributes**: 
- model: Specifies the model to be used in the serializer.
- exclude: Defines a list of fields to be excluded from the serialization process.
- read_only_fields: Specifies a list of fields that should be read-only during serialization.

**Code Description**: 
The Meta class in the GoodsunitPartialUpdateSerializer provides configuration options for the serializer. 
- The 'model' attribute is set to ListModel, indicating the model that the serializer should use.
- The 'exclude' attribute contains a list of fields ('openid', 'is_delete') that should be excluded from the serialized data.
- The 'read_only_fields' attribute specifies fields ('id', 'create_time', 'update_time') that should be treated as read-only during serialization.
