## ClassDef ListModel
**ListModel**: The function of ListModel is to represent a model that stores information about goods units, including the unit name, creator, associated openid, deletion status, creation time, and last update time.

**attributes**: 
- goods_unit: A CharField storing the name of the goods unit.
- creater: A CharField storing the name of the user who created the goods unit.
- openid: A CharField storing the associated openid.
- is_delete: A BooleanField indicating the deletion status of the goods unit.
- create_time: A DateTimeField storing the creation time of the goods unit.
- update_time: A DateTimeField storing the last update time of the goods unit.

**Code Description**: 
The ListModel class defines a model in Django ORM representing goods units. It contains fields to store information such as the name of the goods unit, creator, associated openid, deletion status, creation time, and last update time. The Meta class within ListModel specifies the database table name, verbose names for the model and its plural form, and the default ordering based on the goods_unit field.

**Note**: 
Developers can use ListModel to interact with the database table 'goodsunit' to manage goods units in the application. The class provides a structured way to store and retrieve information related to goods units, facilitating data management and retrieval operations within the application.
### ClassDef Meta
**Meta**: The function of Meta is to define metadata options for the ListModel class.

**attributes**:
- db_table: Specifies the database table name for the model.
- verbose_name: Sets a human-readable name for the model.
- verbose_name_plural: Sets a human-readable plural name for the model.
- ordering: Defines the default ordering for query sets of the model.

**Code Description**:
The Meta class in the ListModel defines metadata options for the model. The `db_table` attribute specifies the name of the database table associated with the model. The `verbose_name` attribute provides a human-readable name for the model, while `verbose_name_plural` sets the plural name. The `ordering` attribute determines the default ordering of query sets for the model based on the 'goods_unit' field.

**Note**:
Developers can customize the behavior of the ListModel class by adjusting the attributes within the Meta class. The `ordering` attribute is particularly useful for specifying the default ordering of query sets.
