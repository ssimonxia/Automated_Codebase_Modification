## FunctionDef file_headers
**file_headers**: The function of file_headers is to return a list of specific headers related to supplier information.
**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: The file_headers function returns a list of headers including 'supplier_name', 'supplier_city', 'supplier_address', 'supplier_contact', 'supplier_manager', 'supplier_level', 'creater', 'create_time', and 'update_time'. These headers are related to supplier details.
In the project, the file_headers function is called by two classes: FileRenderCN and FileRenderEN. Both classes inherit from CSVStreamingRenderer and assign the result of file_headers to the header attribute. This ensures that the headers for the CSV files generated by these classes include the supplier-related information.
**Note**: The file_headers function is a simple utility function that provides predefined headers for supplier data. It is used to maintain consistency in the structure of CSV files generated by the FileRenderCN and FileRenderEN classes.
**Output Example**: 
['supplier_name', 'supplier_city', 'supplier_address', 'supplier_contact', 'supplier_manager', 'supplier_level', 'creater', 'create_time', 'update_time']
## FunctionDef cn_data_header
**cn_data_header**: The function of cn_data_header is to return a dictionary containing key-value pairs of Chinese data headers related to supplier information.

**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: The cn_data_header function returns a dictionary with key-value pairs representing various data headers related to supplier information in Chinese. The keys include 'supplier_name', 'supplier_city', 'supplier_address', 'supplier_contact', 'supplier_manager', 'supplier_level', 'creater', 'create_time', and 'update_time', each mapped to the corresponding Chinese translation.

This function is utilized in the FileRenderCN class within the supplier/files.py module to set the labels for CSV rendering. The labels are used to define the headers of the CSV file generated for supplier data. Additionally, the function is also called in the get_lang method of the SupplierfileViewSet and SupplierfileAddViewSet classes in the uploadfile/views.py module to determine the data headers based on the language specified in the request.

**Note**: Ensure that the keys in the dictionary returned by this function match the expected data headers in the application to maintain consistency in data representation.

**Output Example**:
{
    'supplier_name': '供应商名称',
    'supplier_city': '供应商城市',
    'supplier_address': '详细地址',
    'supplier_contact': '联系电话',
    'supplier_manager': '负责人',
    'supplier_level': '供应商等级',
    'creater': '创建人',
    'create_time': '创建时间',
    'update_time': '更新时间'
}
## FunctionDef en_data_header
**en_data_header**: The function of en_data_header is to return a dictionary containing English labels for supplier data fields.

**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: The en_data_header function returns a dictionary with English labels for various supplier data fields such as supplier name, city, address, contact, manager, level, creator, create time, and update time. These labels are used to represent the corresponding data fields in a user-friendly manner.

In the project, the en_data_header function is called in multiple places. In the FileRenderEN class in the files.py file, the en_data_header function is assigned to the labels attribute. This indicates that the English labels returned by en_data_header will be used in the FileRenderEN class for rendering CSV files.

Additionally, in the SupplierfileViewSet and SupplierfileAddViewSet classes in the views.py file, the get_lang method calls the en_data_header function based on the language specified in the request. This ensures that the appropriate English labels are used for supplier data fields depending on the language context.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the en_data_header function is called in the correct context to provide accurate English labels for supplier data fields.

**Output Example**: 
{
    'supplier_name': 'Supplier Name',
    'supplier_city': 'Supplier City',
    'supplier_address': 'Supplier Address',
    'supplier_contact': 'Supplier Contact',
    'supplier_manager': 'Supplier Manager',
    'supplier_level': 'Supplier Level',
    'creater': 'Creater',
    'create_time': 'Create Time',
    'update_time': 'Update Time',
}
## ClassDef FileRenderCN
**FileRenderCN**: The function of FileRenderCN is to render CSV files with headers and labels specific to supplier information in Chinese.

**attributes**:
- header: Contains the list of headers related to supplier information.
- labels: Contains a dictionary with Chinese translations of data headers related to supplier information.

**Code Description**: 
FileRenderCN is a class that inherits from CSVStreamingRenderer and is designed to handle the rendering of CSV files with supplier data. The class utilizes the `header` attribute to store the list of headers obtained from the `file_headers` function, which includes details such as supplier name, city, address, contact, manager, level, creator, creation time, and update time. Additionally, the `labels` attribute stores a dictionary returned by the `cn_data_header` function, providing Chinese translations for the data headers. This ensures that the CSV files generated by FileRenderCN contain supplier information with Chinese labels.

The `header` and `labels` attributes play a crucial role in maintaining consistency and clarity in the representation of supplier data within the CSV files. By incorporating these attributes, FileRenderCN enhances the user experience by presenting information in a structured and language-specific manner.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the `file_headers` and `cn_data_header` functions are correctly implemented and return the expected headers and translations to guarantee the proper functioning of FileRenderCN in rendering CSV files with accurate supplier information.
## ClassDef FileRenderEN
**FileRenderEN**: The function of FileRenderEN is to render CSV files with English labels for supplier data fields.

**attributes**:
- header: Contains a list of specific headers related to supplier information.
- labels: Contains a dictionary with English labels for supplier data fields.

**Code Description**:
FileRenderEN is a class that inherits from CSVStreamingRenderer and is responsible for rendering CSV files with English labels for supplier data fields. The class initializes two attributes:
1. header: This attribute is assigned the result of the file_headers function, which provides a list of specific headers related to supplier information such as supplier name, city, address, contact, manager, level, creator, create time, and update time.
2. labels: This attribute is assigned the result of the en_data_header function, which returns a dictionary containing English labels for various supplier data fields.

The file_headers function ensures consistency in the structure of CSV files by providing predefined headers, while the en_data_header function offers user-friendly English labels for supplier data fields. By assigning these results to the header and labels attributes, FileRenderEN class ensures that the generated CSV files have the appropriate headers and labels for supplier data.

**Note**: FileRenderEN class plays a crucial role in generating CSV files with accurate English labels for supplier data fields. It relies on the file_headers and en_data_header functions to maintain consistency and user-friendliness in the rendered files.
