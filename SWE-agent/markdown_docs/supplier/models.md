**Code Description**: 
The ListModel class defines a model for storing supplier details such as name, city, address, contact information, manager, level, creator, Openid, deletion status, creation time, and update time. It inherits from the models.Model class provided by Django's ORM. The Meta class within ListModel specifies metadata such as the database table name, verbose names, and default ordering based on the supplier name. 

**Note**: 
Developers can use ListModel to create instances representing supplier information in the database. The attributes defined in ListModel correspond to different aspects of supplier details, providing a structured way to manage and retrieve supplier information in the application. The Meta class settings help in customizing the behavior of ListModel in the database and admin interface.

- ordering: Defines the default ordering for query sets of the model.

**Code Description**:
