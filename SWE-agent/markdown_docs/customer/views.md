## ClassDef APIViewSet
**APIViewSet**: The function of APIViewSet is to handle various CRUD operations for a specific model.

**attributes**:
- pagination_class: MyPageNumberPagination
- filter_backends: DjangoFilterBackend, OrderingFilter
- ordering_fields: ['id', "create_time", "update_time"]
- filter_class: Filter

**Code Description**:
The APIViewSet class defines methods for retrieving, creating, updating, partially updating, and deleting data entries. It includes functions to handle different HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. The class utilizes serializers to validate and save data, and it checks permissions based on the requesting user's authentication. Additionally, the class specifies pagination, filtering, and ordering options for the data.

The get_project method retrieves the project ID from the request parameters. The get_queryset method filters the data based on the requesting user's authentication and the project ID. The get_serializer_class method determines the serializer class based on the action performed.

The create method creates a new data entry, checking for existing data before saving. The update method updates an existing data entry, while the partial_update method partially updates it. The destroy method marks a data entry as deleted.

**Note**:
- Ensure proper authentication and permissions are set up to control data access.
- Handle serializer validation errors appropriately to maintain data integrity.

**Output Example**:
{
    "id": 1,
    "customer_name": "John Doe",
    "email": "johndoe@example.com",
    "phone": "1234567890",
    "created_at": "2022-01-01T12:00:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2022-01-02T10:00:00Z",
    "is_delete": false
}
### FunctionDef get_project(self)
**get_project**: The function of get_project is to retrieve the 'pk' value from the self.kwargs dictionary and return it.

**parameters**:
- self: The reference to the current instance of the class.

**Code Description**:
The get_project function attempts to retrieve the 'pk' value from the self.kwargs dictionary. If successful, it returns the value; otherwise, it returns None.

In the calling object get_queryset, the get_project function is used to obtain the 'id' value. Depending on the presence of the 'id' value and the authenticated user, the function filters ListModel objects accordingly and returns the filtered queryset.

**Note**:
It is important to handle exceptions properly when using the get_project function to ensure smooth execution and error handling.

**Output Example**:
If the 'pk' value is found in self.kwargs:
```
123
```
If the 'pk' value is not found in self.kwargs:
```
None
```
***
### FunctionDef get_queryset(self)
**get_queryset**: The function of get_queryset is to filter ListModel objects based on the presence of an 'id' value and an authenticated user.

**parameters**:
- self: The reference to the current instance of the class.

**Code Description**:
The get_queryset function first calls the get_project function to retrieve the 'id' value. It then checks if the request has an authenticated user. If the 'id' is None, it filters ListModel objects by 'openid' and 'is_delete' status. If the 'id' is present, it filters by 'openid', 'id', and 'is_delete' status. If there is no authenticated user, it returns an empty queryset.

The function ensures that the ListModel objects are filtered appropriately based on the conditions, providing different results depending on the 'id' value and user authentication status.

**Note**:
Proper exception handling is crucial when using the get_project function to ensure smooth execution and error handling.

**Output Example**:
Filtered queryset based on conditions:
```
<QuerySet [<ListModel: object1>, <ListModel: object2>]>
```
***
### FunctionDef get_serializer_class(self)
**get_serializer_class**: The function of get_serializer_class is to determine the appropriate serializer class based on the action being performed.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.
  
**Code Description**:
The get_serializer_class function checks the action being performed and returns the corresponding serializer class based on the action type. If the action is 'list', 'retrieve', or 'destroy', it returns the CustomerGetSerializer. For 'create' action, it returns the CustomerPostSerializer. If the action is 'update', it returns the CustomerUpdateSerializer, and for 'partial_update', it returns the CustomerPartialUpdateSerializer. If none of the specified actions match, it calls the http_method_not_allowed method.

This function is crucial in determining the appropriate serializer class to handle the serialization and validation of data for different actions within the APIViewSet class. By returning the specific serializer class based on the action, it ensures that the data is processed correctly and consistently according to the action type.

**Note**:
Developers should ensure that the actions specified in the function align with the actions defined in the serializers to maintain consistency in data handling and validation.

**Output Example**:
- If the action is 'list':
  - Returns: CustomerGetSerializer

- If the action is 'create':
  - Returns: CustomerPostSerializer

- If the action is 'update':
  - Returns: CustomerUpdateSerializer

- If the action is 'partial_update':
  - Returns: CustomerPartialUpdateSerializer

### FunctionDef create(self, request)
**create**: The function of create is to handle the creation of a new object while ensuring the uniqueness of certain data fields.

**parameters**:
- request: Represents the request made to the API.
- *args: Additional positional arguments.
- **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments.

**Code Description**:
The create function first retrieves the data from the request object and then adds the 'openid' field from the authentication data. It checks if an object with the same 'openid', 'customer_name', and 'is_delete' fields already exists in the ListModel. If the object exists, it raises an APIException with a message indicating that the data already exists. If the object does not exist, it proceeds to validate the data using a serializer, saves the data, and returns a response with the serialized data and a success status code.

**Note**:
- This function assumes the existence of a ListModel to perform data validation and creation.
- The function relies on the availability of request data and authentication data.
- It is important to handle the APIException that may be raised when data already exists.

**Output Example**:

    "id": 1,
    "customer_name": "John Doe",
    "openid": "abc123",
    "is_delete": false
}
***
### FunctionDef update(self, request, pk)
**update**: The function of update is to update a specific object instance.

**parameters**:
- request: Represents the request made to update the object.
- pk: Represents the primary key of the object to be updated.

**Code Description**:
The update function first retrieves the object to be updated using the get_object method. It then checks if the openid of the object matches the openid of the authenticated request. If they do not match, an APIException is raised. Otherwise, the function proceeds to update the object with the data from the request. The data is validated using a serializer, and if valid, the changes are saved. Finally, the function returns a response with the updated data and a success status code along with any additional headers.

**Note**:
- This function assumes the presence of a get_object method, a get_serializer method, and a get_success_headers method within the same class.
- It is important to ensure that the request contains the necessary data for updating the object and that the authentication mechanism is in place to verify the ownership of the object.

**Output Example**:
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Updated Name",
    "description": "Updated Description"
}
***
### FunctionDef partial_update(self, request, pk)
**partial_update**: The function of partial_update is to partially update an object based on the provided data if the authenticated user owns the object.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.
- request: The request object containing metadata about the request.
- pk: The primary key of the object to be updated.

**Code Description**:
The partial_update function first retrieves the object to be updated using the get_object method. It then checks if the openid of the object matches the openid of the authenticated user. If they do not match, an APIException is raised. If the openids match, the function proceeds to update the object with the provided data. The function uses the serializer to validate the data, save the changes, and generate success headers. Finally, it returns a response with the updated data and a status code of 200.

**Note**:
- This function is designed to update only a part of the object's data, hence the name "partial_update".
- It is important to ensure that the authenticated user has the necessary permissions to update the object.

```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Updated Name",
    "description": "Updated Description"
}
```
***
### FunctionDef destroy(self, request, pk)
**destroy**: The function of destroy is to delete a specific object after checking if the object belongs to the authenticated user.

**parameters**:
- request: Represents the request made to the API.
- pk: Represents the primary key of the object to be deleted.

**Code Description**:
The destroy function first retrieves the object to be deleted using the get_object method. It then checks if the openid of the object does not match the openid of the authenticated user. If the condition is met, an APIException is raised with a message indicating that the data cannot be deleted as it does not belong to the user. If the condition is not met, the is_delete attribute of the object is set to True, and the object is saved. The function then generates a serializer for the object, obtains success headers, and returns a response with the serialized data, a status code of 200, and the success headers.

**Note**:
- This function is designed to ensure that only the owner of the data can delete it.
- It is important to handle the APIException appropriately when using this function.

**Output Example**:
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Example Object",
    "is_delete": true
}

- renderer_classes: Tuple containing the renderer classes for file rendering.
- filter_backends: List of filter backends for queryset filtering.
- ordering_fields: List of fields for ordering the queryset.
- filter_class: Class for filtering the queryset.

**Code Description**:
FileDownloadView is a class that extends ModelViewSet and implements various methods to facilitate file downloads. The class utilizes renderer_classes to specify the renderer for file rendering, filter_backends to define filtering backends, ordering_fields to set ordering fields, and filter_class to specify the filter class for queryset filtering.

The get_project method retrieves the project ID from the request parameters. The get_queryset method filters the queryset based on the user and project ID, ensuring only valid data is returned. The get_serializer_class method determines the serializer class based on the action performed. The get_lang method selects the appropriate renderer based on the language specified in the request.

In the list method, the class generates a CSV file by iterating over instances of the queryset, rendering the data with the selected language renderer, and creating a StreamingHttpResponse for file download with the correct content type and filename.

FileDownloadView interacts with FileRenderCN and FileRenderEN classes to render CSV files with language-specific headers, ensuring proper data representation based on the user's language preference.

**Note**: When using FileDownloadView, ensure that the language parameter is correctly set in the request to generate the desired CSV output with the appropriate headers.

**Output Example**:
A CSV file is generated with customer data in Chinese language headers for download.
### FunctionDef get_project(self)
**get_project**: The function of get_project is to retrieve the 'pk' value from the self.kwargs dictionary and return it.

**parameters**: 
- No parameters are explicitly passed to this function, as it operates on the self object.

**Code Description**: 
The get_project function first attempts to retrieve the 'pk' value from the self.kwargs dictionary using the get method. If successful, it returns the retrieved 'pk' value. If an exception occurs during the retrieval process, the function returns None.

In the context of the project, the get_project function is called within the get_queryset method of the FileDownloadView class. In this scenario, the get_project function is used to obtain the 'id' value, which is then utilized to filter ListModel objects based on specific conditions.

**Note**: 
- It is important to handle exceptions appropriately when using the get_project function to ensure robust error management.
- Ensure that the self.kwargs dictionary contains the 'pk' key before calling the get_project function to avoid potential KeyError exceptions.

**Output Example**: 
If the 'pk' value is successfully retrieved from self.kwargs:
```
123
```
If an exception occurs during the retrieval process:
```
None
```
***
### FunctionDef get_queryset(self)
**get_queryset**: The function of get_queryset is to retrieve the 'id' value based on specific conditions and filter ListModel objects accordingly.

**parameters**: 
- No explicit parameters are passed to this function.

**Code Description**: 
The get_queryset function first calls the get_project function to obtain the 'id' value. It then checks if the request user exists and filters ListModel objects based on the 'openid', 'id', and 'is_delete' conditions. If the request user does not exist, an empty queryset is returned.

The get_queryset function is an integral part of the FileDownloadView class in the customer/views.py file. It utilizes the get_project function to extract the 'id' value, which is crucial for filtering ListModel objects accurately.

**Note**: 
- Proper exception handling is essential when using the get_project function to ensure robust error management.
- Ensure that the 'pk' key is present in the self.kwargs dictionary before invoking the get_project function to prevent potential KeyError exceptions.

**Output Example**: 
If the 'id' value is successfully retrieved and conditions are met:
```
<QuerySet [<ListModel: object1>, <ListModel: object2>]>
```
If the request user does not exist:
```
<QuerySet []>
```
***
### FunctionDef get_serializer_class(self)
**get_serializer_class**: The function of get_serializer_class is to determine the serializer class based on the action type and return the appropriate serializer for further processing.

**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: The get_serializer_class function checks the action type, and if the action is 'list', it returns the FileRenderSerializer class from the serializers module. Otherwise, it calls the http_method_not_allowed method with the request parameter.

The FileRenderSerializer class is responsible for serializing customer information data into a specific format for rendering. It includes fields such as customer_name, customer_city, customer_address, customer_contact, customer_manager, customer_level, creater, create_time, and update_time. The Meta class defines the model to be used, sets a reference name, and excludes certain fields from serialization.

In the context of the project, the get_serializer_class function in the FileDownloadView class of customer/views.py utilizes the FileRenderSerializer to serialize instances when the action is 'list'. This serialization process prepares the data for rendering in a specific format suitable for CSV file download.

**Note**: Developers can customize the serialization behavior by adjusting the attributes and Meta class of the FileRenderSerializer as needed.

**Output Example**:
```python
return serializers.FileRenderSerializer
```
***
### FunctionDef get_lang(self, data)
**get_lang**: The function of get_lang is to determine the language specified in the request and render a CSV file with the appropriate headers based on the language.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.
- data: The data to be rendered in the CSV file.

**Code Description**:
The get_lang function retrieves the language from the request's metadata and checks if it is set to 'zh-hans' for Chinese. If the language is Chinese, it calls the FileRenderCN class to render the CSV file with Chinese headers. Otherwise, it uses the FileRenderEN class to render the CSV file with English headers. If no language is specified, the function defaults to rendering the CSV file with English headers. This function plays a crucial role in generating language-specific CSV files based on the request's language parameter.

In the project structure, get_lang is called within the list method of the FileDownloadView class in views.py to generate a CSV file with the appropriate headers for customer data. By utilizing the language parameter, get_lang ensures that the CSV file is rendered correctly with the corresponding headers for better data representation.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the language parameter is correctly set in the request to generate the desired CSV output with the appropriate headers in the specified language.

**Output Example**:
A CSV file is rendered with the headers in the selected language based on the request's language parameter.
***
