## ClassDef Filter
**Filter**: The function of Filter is to define filtering options for the ListModel.

**attributes**: 
- model: Represents the ListModel to be filtered.
- fields: Contains a dictionary where keys are field names of the ListModel and values are lists of filter options available for each field.

**Code Description**:
The Filter class extends FilterSet and provides a way to specify filtering options for the ListModel. The Meta inner class is used to define the model to be filtered and the available filter options for each field of the model. The fields attribute is a dictionary where each key represents a field of the ListModel, and the corresponding value is a list of filter options that can be applied to that field. These filter options include 'exact', 'iexact', 'contains', 'icontains', 'gt', 'gte', 'lt', 'lte', 'isnull', 'in', 'range', 'year', 'month', 'day', 'week_day'. By defining these filter options, developers can customize how data is filtered when querying the ListModel.

**Note**: It is important to carefully choose the appropriate filter options for each field to ensure accurate and efficient filtering of data.
### ClassDef Meta
**Meta**: The function of Meta is to define metadata options for the Filter class.

**attributes**: 
- model: Represents the model to be used for filtering.
- fields: Contains a dictionary where each key represents a field name and the corresponding value is a list of filter options available for that field.

**Code Description**: 
The Meta class in the Filter class defines metadata options for filtering data. It specifies the model to be used for filtering and lists the available filter options for each field in the model. The fields attribute is a dictionary where each key is a field name, and the corresponding value is a list of filter options that can be applied to that field. These filter options include 'exact', 'iexact', 'contains', 'icontains', 'gt', 'gte', 'lt', 'lte', 'isnull', 'in', 'range', 'year', 'month', 'day', 'week_day'. Developers can use these filter options to query and filter data based on specific criteria.

**Note**: 
Developers can customize the filter options for each field by modifying the fields attribute in the Meta class. This allows for flexible and tailored filtering of data based on the requirements of the application.
