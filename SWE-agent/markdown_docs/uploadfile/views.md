### FunctionDef get_lang(self)
**get_lang**: The function of get_lang is to retrieve the language specified in the request and return the corresponding data header based on the language. 

**parameters**: 
- No parameters are required for this function.

**Code Description**: 
The `get_lang` function first checks if the request has a user. If a user is present, it retrieves the language from the `HTTP_LANGUAGE` header in the request's `META` attribute. If there is no user, it sets the language to 'en-US' by default.

Based on the language value, the function determines which data header to use. If the language is 'zh-hans', it calls the `cn_data_header` function from the `goodsfiles` module to get the Chinese translation of the data header. If the language is 'en-US' or any other value, it calls the `en_data_header` function from the same module to get the English data header.

The function then returns the data header.

The `get_lang` function is called in the `post` method of the `GoodlistfileViewSet` class in the `views.py` file. In this method, the data header is retrieved based on the language specified in the request. This ensures that the correct data header is used for processing the uploaded file.

**Note**: 
- The `get_lang` function assumes that the language is specified in the `HTTP_LANGUAGE` header of the request's `META` attribute. Make sure that the language is properly set in the request for accurate data header retrieval.
- The `cn_data_header` and `en_data_header` functions are referenced in the `get_lang` method. Ensure that these functions are implemented correctly and return the expected data headers in Chinese and English, respectively.

**Output Example**:
{
    'goods_code': '商品编码',

### FunctionDef post(self, request)
**post**: The post function is responsible for processing a file upload request and populating the database with new goodslist data from the uploaded file.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.
- request: The request object containing the file upload data.
- *args: Additional positional arguments.
- **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments.

**Code Description**: 
The post function begins by retrieving the language specified in the request using the get_lang() method. It then retrieves the uploaded file from the request using the FILES attribute and checks if the file exists. If a file is present, it extracts the file extension to determine the type of file.

Next, the function retrieves the staff name associated with the authenticated user from the staff model. It then proceeds to delete existing data from various related models, including goodsunit, goodsclass, goodsbrand, goodscolor, goodsshape, goodsspecs, goodsorigin, and scanner.

Depending on the file type (xlsx, xls, or csv), the function reads the file using the pandas library. It drops any duplicate rows in the file and retrieves the data header using the get_lang() method.

The function then iterates over each row in the data list and performs data validation using the data_validate() function. It checks if the first column (goods_code) is empty and skips the row if it is. For other columns, it checks if they are empty and replaces them with 'N/A' if they are. It also checks if the numeric columns contain valid numeric values and replaces them with 0 if they are not.

For each row, a unique bar_code is generated using the md5() function from the Md5 class. The function then creates a new goodslist object with the extracted data from the row, including the bar_code and staff name.

Additionally, the function creates a new scanner object for each goodslist item, associating it with the authenticated user and the generated bar_code.

The function then retrieves unique values from the goods_supplier column and creates new supplier objects if they do not already exist.

Similarly, it retrieves unique values from the goods_unit, goods_class, goods_brand, goods_color, goods_shape, goods_specs, and goods_origin columns, creating new objects for each if they do not already exist.

If the file type is not supported (other than xlsx, xls, or csv), the function raises an APIException with a corresponding error message.

If no file is present in the request, the function raises an APIException with a message to select a file.

Finally, the function returns a success response.

**Note**: 
- The function relies on the get_lang(), data_validate(), and md5() functions, as well as the staff, goodsunit, goodsclass, goodsbrand, goodscolor, goodsshape, goodsspecs, goodsorigin, and scanner models. Ensure that these functions and models are implemented correctly and available in the project.
- The function assumes that the pandas library is installed and imported correctly.
- The function assumes that the goodslist, supplier, and scanner models are available and have the required fields.
- The function assumes that the staff model has the openid and staff_name fields.
- The function assumes that the request object has the FILES, META, and auth attributes.
- The function assumes that the APIException class is available and can be raised with the appropriate error messages.

**Output Example**: 
{
    "detail": "success"
}

### FunctionDef post(self, request)
**post**: The post function is responsible for processing the uploaded file and extracting data from it to create new records in the database. It performs various data validation and manipulation tasks before storing the data.

**parameters**:
- request: The HTTP request object containing the uploaded file and other request data.
- *args: Additional positional arguments.
- **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments.

**Code Description**:
The post function begins by calling the get_lang function to retrieve the data header based on the language specified in the request. The data header is used for data processing tasks related to goods information.

Next, the function retrieves the uploaded file from the request's FILES attribute. It checks if the file exists and then determines the file type based on its extension. If the file type is supported (xlsx, xls, or csv), the function proceeds with data processing. Otherwise, it raises an APIException with a corresponding error message.

The function uses the pandas library to read the file data into a dataframe. It then performs several data manipulation tasks, including dropping duplicate rows, extracting specific columns, and converting certain values to their appropriate types.

For each row in the data list, the function calls the data_validate function to check for any potentially malicious data. If the data passes the validation, it proceeds with further processing.

The function checks if the goods item already exists in the database based on its goods code. If it does not exist, it creates a new record in the goodslist table with the extracted data. It also creates a corresponding record in the scanner table.

The function then retrieves unique values from specific columns in the dataframe, such as goods_supplier, goods_unit, goods_class, goods_brand, goods_color, goods_shape, goods_specs, and goods_origin. For each unique value, it checks if a corresponding record already exists in the database. If not, it creates a new record in the respective table.

Finally, if all the data processing tasks are successful, the function returns a response with a success message. Otherwise, it raises an APIException with a corresponding error message.

**Note**:
- The get_lang function is called to retrieve the data header based on the language specified in the request. The language value is expected to be either 'zh-hans' or 'en-US'. If the language value is neither of these, the function defaults to using the English data header.
- The data_validate function is called to check for potentially malicious data. It raises an APIException if any malicious data is found.
- The usage of the pandas library assumes that it is correctly installed and imported in the project.
- The function assumes that the necessary models (goodslist, scanner, supplier, goodsunit, goodsclass, goodsbrand, goodscolor, goodsshape, goodsspecs, goodsorigin) are defined and imported in the project.
- The function assumes that the necessary database tables are already created and properly configured.
- The function assumes that the necessary authentication and authorization checks are performed before calling this function.

**Output Example**:
{
    "detail": "success"
}
