## ClassDef Migration
**Migration**: The function of Migration is to define a database migration operation for creating a new model called 'Users' with specific fields and options.

- initial: A boolean attribute set to True indicating that this migration is the initial one.
- dependencies: A list of dependencies for this migration operation, which is empty in this case.
- operations: A list containing a single operation to create a new model 'Users' with specified fields and options.

**Code Description**:
The Migration class inherits from migrations.Migration and defines the database migration operation to create a new model 'Users'. The 'Users' model consists of various fields such as 'user_id', 'name', 'vip', 'openid', 'appid', 'is_delete', 'developer', 't_code', 'ip', 'vip_time', 'link_to', 'link_to_id', 'avatar', 'create_time', and 'update_time'. These fields have different data types and options like default values, verbose names, and auto-generated timestamps. Additionally, the model has meta options like verbose_name, verbose_name_plural, db_table, and ordering.

**Note**:
Developers can customize the model fields, options, and meta options according to their specific requirements by modifying the operations list in the Migration class.
