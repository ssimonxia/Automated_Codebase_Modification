**Code Description**:
The Users class is a model class that extends the models.Model class provided by Django. It represents the user profile table in the database. The class defines various fields to store user information such as user_id, name, vip, openid, appid, is_delete, developer, t_code, ip, vip_time, link_to, link_to_id, avatar, create_time, and update_time.

The class also includes a nested Meta class that provides metadata for the model. The Meta class specifies the database table name, verbose names for the model, and the default ordering of the model instances.

The Users class is used in various parts of the project. It is called by the following objects:
- cyclecount/views.py/ManualCyclecountViewSet/get_queryset: The get_queryset method of the ManualCyclecountViewSet class uses the Users model to filter cycle count data based on user VIP level and update time.
- cyclecount/views.py/ManualCyclecountRecorderViewSet/get_queryset: The get_queryset method of the ManualCyclecountRecorderViewSet class uses the Users model to filter cycle count recorder data based on user VIP level and update time.
- cyclecount/views.py/ManualFileDownloadView/get_queryset: The get_queryset method of the ManualFileDownloadView class uses the Users model to filter cycle count data based on user VIP level and update time.
- userlogin/views.py/login: The login function uses the Users model to authenticate and log in users.
- userregister/views.py/register: The register function uses the Users model to create new user profiles.

**Note**: The Users class represents user profiles in the userprofile application. It provides fields to store user information and is used in various parts of the project for user authentication, data filtering, and user profile creation.
### ClassDef Meta
**Meta**: The function of Meta is to define metadata options for the Users model.

**attributes**:
- db_table: Specifies the database table name for the model as 'user_profile'.
- verbose_name: Sets a human-readable name for the model as 'User Profile'.
- verbose_name_plural: Provides a plural name for the model as 'User Profile'.
- ordering: Defines the default ordering for query results as descending by 'id'.

**Code Description**:
The Meta class in the Users model defines metadata options that control the behavior of the model in Django. The db_table attribute specifies the name of the database table to use for the model. The verbose_name attribute sets a human-readable name for the model, while verbose_name_plural provides a plural name for the model. The ordering attribute specifies the default ordering of query results, in this case, ordering by the 'id' field in descending order.

**Note**:
It is important to understand that the Meta class in Django models allows developers to customize various options and behaviors of the model. By defining these metadata options, developers can control how the model interacts with the database and how it is displayed in the Django admin interface.
