## FunctionDef login(request)
**login**: The login function is responsible for authenticating and logging in users based on the provided credentials.

**parameters**:
- request: The HTTP request object containing information about the request.
- *args: Variable length argument list.
- **kwargs: Arbitrary keyword arguments.

**Code Description**:
The login function takes in an HTTP request object, *args, and **kwargs as parameters. It first decodes the request body, which is expected to be in JSON format, and retrieves the username and password from the decoded data. It then retrieves the client's IP address from the request's META data.

The function checks if a user with the provided username exists in the User model. If the user exists, it attempts to authenticate the user using the provided username and password. If the authentication fails, an error response is constructed using the FBMsg.err_ret() method, and the response is returned as a JSON response.

If the authentication is successful, the function proceeds to log in the user using the auth.login() method. It then retrieves additional user details from the Users model based on the authenticated user's ID. The function also retrieves the staff ID from the staff model based on the user's openid and staff name.

The function constructs a data dictionary containing the user's name, openid, and staff ID. It then constructs a success response using the FBMsg.ret() method, adds the client's IP address and the data dictionary to the response, and returns it as a JSON response.

If a user with the provided username does not exist in the User model, an error response is constructed using the FBMsg.err_ret() method. The client's IP address and the data dictionary are added to the response, and it is returned as a JSON response.

**Note**:
- The login function expects the request body to contain a JSON object with "name" and "password" fields.
- The function uses the User and Users models to authenticate and retrieve user details.
- The FBMsg.err_ret() and FBMsg.ret() methods are used to construct error and success responses, respectively.

**Output Example**:
{
    "code": "200",
    "msg": "Success Create",
    "data": {
        "name": "example_user",
        "openid": "example_openid",
        "user_id": 12345
    }
}
