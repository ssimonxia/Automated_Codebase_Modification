## ClassDef APIViewSet
**APIViewSet**: The function of APIViewSet is to handle various actions such as retrieving, listing, creating, updating, partial updating, and deleting data in the ListModel. 

**attributes**:
- pagination_class: MyPageNumberPagination
- filter_backends: DjangoFilterBackend, OrderingFilter
- ordering_fields: ['id', "create_time", "update_time"]
- filter_class: Filter

**Code Description**:
The APIViewSet class extends viewsets.ModelViewSet and includes methods to interact with ListModel data. It utilizes the Filter class to define filter options for data filtering based on specific fields. The class also specifies pagination, filter backends, ordering fields, and serializer classes for different actions like retrieving, listing, creating, updating, and deleting data.

The get_project method retrieves the project ID from the request parameters. The get_queryset method filters ListModel data based on the user and project ID, ensuring data integrity and security.

The get_serializer_class method returns the appropriate serializer class based on the action being performed. The create, update, partial_update, and destroy methods handle data creation, updating, partial updating, and deletion operations, respectively, while enforcing specific business logic and data validation rules.

The class integrates with the Filter class to apply custom filtering options when interacting with ListModel data, ensuring data consistency and adherence to defined filter criteria.

**Note**:
Developers can customize the filter options, pagination settings, and serializer classes as needed to suit their specific requirements for handling ListModel data.

**Output Example**:
A Response object containing the serialized data and HTTP status code.
### FunctionDef get_project(self)
**get_project**: The function of get_project is to retrieve the 'pk' value from the self.kwargs dictionary and return it.

**parameters**:
- self: The reference to the current instance of the class.

**Code Description**:
The get_project function attempts to retrieve the 'pk' value from the self.kwargs dictionary. If successful, it returns the value; otherwise, it returns None.

In the calling object get_queryset, the get_project function is invoked to obtain the 'id' value. Based on the 'id' value and the presence of the request user, the function filters ListModel objects accordingly and returns the filtered queryset.

**Note**: 
- The get_project function is designed to handle exceptions by returning None if the 'pk' value cannot be retrieved.
- Ensure that self.kwargs contains the 'pk' key before calling this function to avoid potential errors.

**Output Example**:
If the 'pk' value is successfully retrieved from self.kwargs:
```
123
```

If an exception occurs or 'pk' is not found:
```
None
```
***
### FunctionDef get_queryset(self)
**get_queryset**: The function of get_queryset is to filter ListModel objects based on the presence of the request user and the 'id' value obtained from the get_project function.

**parameters**:
- self: The reference to the current instance of the class.

**Code Description**:
The get_queryset function first retrieves the 'id' value by calling the get_project function. It then checks if the request user exists. If the 'id' is None, the function filters ListModel objects by openid and deletion status. If the 'id' is not None, it filters ListModel objects by openid, id, and deletion status. If the request user does not exist, an empty queryset is returned.

This function is crucial for obtaining a filtered queryset of ListModel objects based on specific conditions, allowing for efficient data retrieval based on user and 'id' values.

**Note**: Developers should ensure that the get_project function is correctly implemented and returns the expected 'id' value to avoid potential errors in filtering ListModel objects. Proper handling of user authentication and data filtering logic is essential for the accurate retrieval of warehouse information.

**Output Example**:
If the request user exists and 'id' is None:
```
<QuerySet [<ListModel: warehouse1>, <ListModel: warehouse2>]>
```

If the request user exists and 'id' is not None:
```
<QuerySet [<ListModel: warehouse3>]>
```

If the request user does not exist:
```
<QuerySet []>
```

### FunctionDef get_serializer_class(self)
**get_serializer_class**: The function of get_serializer_class is to determine the appropriate serializer class based on the action being performed within the APIViewSet.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.
  
**Code Description**:
The `get_serializer_class` method in the APIViewSet class checks the action being performed and returns the corresponding serializer class. If the action is 'list', 'retrieve', or 'destroy', it returns the `WarehouseGetSerializer`. For the 'create' action, it returns the `WarehousePostSerializer`. If the action is 'update', the method returns the `WarehouseUpdateSerializer`, and for 'partial_update', it returns the `WarehousePartialUpdateSerializer`. In case of an unsupported action, it calls the `http_method_not_allowed` method.

This method ensures that the appropriate serializer is used for each action, allowing for proper serialization and validation of warehouse data based on the specific operation being executed.

**Note**:
Developers should ensure that the actions defined in this method align with the available serializer classes to handle the corresponding operations effectively.

**Output Example**:
- If the action is 'list', the method returns WarehouseGetSerializer.
- If the action is 'create', the method returns WarehousePostSerializer.
- If the action is 'update', the method returns WarehouseUpdateSerializer.
- If the action is 'partial_update', the method returns WarehousePartialUpdateSerializer.
***
### FunctionDef create(self, request)
**create**: The function of create is to handle the creation of a new warehouse entry in the system.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.
- request: The HTTP request object.
- *args: Additional positional arguments.
- **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments.

**Code Description**:
The create function within the APIViewSet class in views.py is responsible for creating a new warehouse entry in the system. It first retrieves the data from the request object, adds the openid associated with the warehouse, and performs validation checks. If the warehouse name exceeds 45 characters or if a warehouse with the same name and openid already exists, appropriate exceptions are raised. If the user has already added a warehouse, another exception is raised. If all checks pass, a serializer is instantiated with the data, validated, saved, and a success response is returned with the warehouse data.

The function interacts with the ListModel class from models.py to handle the creation of warehouse entries. It utilizes the ListModel to check for existing warehouse entries, perform data validation, and save the new warehouse information efficiently.

**Note**:
Developers should ensure that the data passed to the create function is valid and follows the expected format to avoid errors during warehouse creation. Proper exception handling is implemented to provide meaningful error messages in case of validation failures or existing data conflicts.

**Output Example**:
{
    "warehouse_name": "Example Warehouse",
    "warehouse_city": "Example City",
    "warehouse_address": "123 Example Street",
    "warehouse_contact": "123-456-7890",
    "warehouse_manager": "John Doe",
    "creater": "Jane Smith",
    "openid": "example_openid",
    "is_delete": false,
    "create_time": "2022-01-01T12:00:00Z",
    "update_time": "2022-01-01T12:00:00Z"
}
***
### FunctionDef update(self, request, pk)
**update**: The function of update is to update a warehouse object with the provided data if certain conditions are met.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.
- request: The request object containing metadata about the request.
- pk: The primary key of the warehouse object to be updated.

**Code Description**:
The update function first retrieves the warehouse object based on the provided primary key. It then checks if the openid associated with the warehouse object matches the openid from the request authentication. If they do not match, an APIException is raised indicating that the data cannot be updated. 
If the condition is met, the function proceeds to validate the data provided for the update. It checks if the length of the 'warehouse_name' field in the data is not more than 45 characters. If it exceeds this limit, an APIException is raised.
Next, the function initializes a serializer with the warehouse object and the provided data, validates the serializer, saves the updated data, and retrieves the success headers.
Finally, the function returns a Response object containing the updated data with a status code of 200 and the success headers.

**Note**:
- This function assumes that the request contains authentication information.
- It is important to ensure that the data provided for the update is valid and adheres to any constraints set by the application.

**Output Example**:
{
    "warehouse_name": "Updated Warehouse Name",
    "location": "Updated Location",
    "capacity": 1000,
    ...
}
***
### FunctionDef partial_update(self, request, pk)
**partial_update**: The function of partial_update is to update a specific object partially based on the provided data.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.
- request: The request object containing metadata about the request.
- pk: The primary key of the object to be updated.

**Code Description**:
The partial_update function first retrieves the object to be updated using the get_object method. It then checks if the openid of the object matches the openid of the authenticated request. If not, it raises an APIException indicating that the data cannot be updated. 
If the condition is met, the function proceeds to validate the data provided in the request. It checks if the length of the 'warehouse_name' field in the data is not more than 45 characters. If it exceeds this limit, it raises an APIException.
Next, the function initializes a serializer with the retrieved object and the provided data, specifying that it is a partial update. The serializer is then validated, and if valid, the changes are saved. Finally, the function generates success headers, constructs a response with the updated data, and returns it with a 200 status code.

**Note**:
- This function is designed to update specific fields of an object, rather than replacing the entire object.
- It enforces a character limit on the 'warehouse_name' field to ensure data integrity.

**Output Example**:
{
    "id": 1,
    "warehouse_name": "Updated Warehouse",
    "location": "New Location",
    "capacity": 1000
}
***
### FunctionDef destroy(self, request, pk)
**destroy**: The function of destroy is to delete a specific object after checking if the requesting user has the permission to do so.

**parameters**:
- request: Represents the request made to delete the object.
- pk: Represents the primary key of the object to be deleted.

**Code Description**:
The destroy function first retrieves the object to be deleted using the get_object method. It then checks if the openid of the requesting user matches the openid associated with the object. If they do not match, an APIException is raised with a message indicating that the data cannot be deleted. If the openids match, the is_delete attribute of the object is set to True, and the object is saved. The function then serializes the updated object, retrieves the success headers, and returns a response with the serialized data and a status code of 200.

**Note**:
- This function assumes the existence of a get_object method, a request object with an auth attribute containing an openid, a save method for the object, a get_serializer method, and a get_success_headers method.
- The function is designed to handle permission checks before deleting the object.

**Output Example**:
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Example Object",
    "is_delete": true
}
***
## ClassDef MultipleViewSet
**MultipleViewSet**: The function of MultipleViewSet is to handle data retrieval and listing operations based on specified filter options.

**attributes**:
- authentication_classes: An empty list for authentication classes.
- pagination_class: MyPageNumberPagination class for pagination settings.
- permission_classes: An empty list for permission classes.
- throttle_classes: An empty list for throttle classes.
- filter_backends: Contains DjangoFilterBackend and OrderingFilter for filtering data.
- ordering_fields: Specifies the ordering field as '-id'.
- filter_class: Utilizes the Filter class for defining filter options.

**Code Description**:
The MultipleViewSet class extends viewsets.ModelViewSet and includes methods to retrieve data, list data, get the project ID, get the queryset based on the project ID and user, and determine the serializer class based on the action type. The class utilizes various attributes such as authentication_classes, pagination_class, permission_classes, throttle_classes, filter_backends, ordering_fields, and filter_class to manage authentication, pagination, permissions, throttling, filtering, and ordering of data.

The get_project method retrieves the project ID from the request parameters. The get_queryset method filters the ListModel data based on the project ID and user, ensuring that only valid data is returned. The get_serializer_class method selects the appropriate serializer class based on the action type, either 'list' or 'retrieve'.

The filter_class attribute is set to the Filter class, which defines filter options for ListModel data based on specific fields and filter types. By using the Filter class, developers can customize the filtering options for ListModel data by modifying the fields dictionary in the Meta class of the Filter class.

In the project, the MultipleViewSet class is utilized in the views.py file to handle data retrieval and listing operations with customized filtering options provided by the Filter class. The class works in conjunction with other components such as serializers, models, and filters to ensure efficient data management and retrieval.

**Note**:
Developers can further extend the functionality of the MultipleViewSet class by customizing the queryset filtering logic, serializer selection, and filter options based on specific project requirements.

**Output Example**:
A response containing a list of data based on the specified filter options and actions performed.
### FunctionDef get_project(self)
**get_project**: The function of get_project is to retrieve the 'pk' value from the self.kwargs dictionary and return it.

**parameters**: 
- self: The reference to the current instance of the class.

**Code Description**: 
The get_project function attempts to retrieve the 'pk' value from the self.kwargs dictionary. If successful, it returns the 'pk' value. If an exception occurs during the process, it returns None.

In the calling object get_queryset, the get_project function is invoked to obtain the 'id' value. Depending on the presence of the 'id' value and the user making the request, different filtering conditions are applied to the ListModel objects before returning the filtered queryset.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the 'pk' key exists in the self.kwargs dictionary to avoid potential exceptions.
- Handle the returned value accordingly as it can be either the 'pk' value or None.

**Output Example**: 
- If 'pk' value exists in self.kwargs: 1
- If 'pk' value does not exist or an exception occurs: None
***
### FunctionDef get_queryset(self)
**get_queryset**: The function of get_queryset is to retrieve the 'id' value from the self.get_project() method and filter ListModel objects based on the presence of 'id' and the user making the request.

**parameters**: None

**Code Description**: The get_queryset function first obtains the 'id' by calling the self.get_project() method. It then checks if the request user exists and applies different filtering conditions to ListModel objects based on the 'id' value. If 'id' is None, it filters objects where 'is_delete' is False. Otherwise, it filters objects by 'id' and 'is_delete' being False. If there is no request user, an empty queryset is returned.

The function utilizes the ListModel class from models.py to filter warehouse information based on specific conditions. By leveraging the get_project method, it dynamically determines the 'id' value to customize the queryset returned to the user.

**Note**: Developers should ensure that proper authentication and authorization mechanisms are in place to handle user requests effectively. Understanding the filtering logic based on 'id' and 'is_delete' fields is crucial for retrieving the desired warehouse data. Additionally, consider error handling and edge cases to maintain the integrity of the queryset returned.

**Output Example**: 
- If the request user exists and 'id' is None: List of ListModel objects where 'is_delete' is False
- If the request user exists and 'id' is not None: List of ListModel objects filtered by 'id' and 'is_delete' being False
- If the request user does not exist: An empty queryset
***
### FunctionDef get_serializer_class(self)
**get_serializer_class**: The function of get_serializer_class is to determine the appropriate serializer class based on the action being performed.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.
  
**Code Description**:
The `get_serializer_class` method checks the action being performed and returns the `WarehouseGetSerializer` if the action is 'list' or 'retrieve'. This method ensures that the correct serializer is used for serializing warehouse data based on the action requested.

The `WarehouseGetSerializer` class defines the serialization behavior for warehouse data, including fields such as warehouse name, city, address, contact information, manager, creator, unique identifier, creation time, and update time. This serializer class is a subclass of `serializers.ModelSerializer` and is designed for read-only purposes.

In the project's structure, the `MultipleViewSet` class in `views.py` utilizes the `get_serializer_class` method to determine the appropriate serializer class for 'list' and 'retrieve' actions. By returning `WarehouseGetSerializer` in these cases, the method ensures that the correct serialization logic is applied based on the action performed.

**Note**:
Developers can rely on the `get_serializer_class` method to dynamically select the serializer class based on the action, allowing for flexible and tailored serialization of warehouse data.

**Output Example**:
If the action is 'list', the method returns `WarehouseGetSerializer`, enabling the serialization of warehouse data for listing purposes.
