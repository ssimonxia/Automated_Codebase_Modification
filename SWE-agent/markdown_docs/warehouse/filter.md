## ClassDef Filter
**Filter**: The function of Filter is to define filter options for the ListModel data based on specific fields.

**attributes**:
- model: ListModel
- fields: A dictionary containing field names as keys and a list of filter options as values.

**Code Description**:
The Filter class is a subclass of FilterSet and is used to specify filtering options for the ListModel data. It defines a Meta class with model set to ListModel and fields containing a dictionary of field names along with the filter options available for each field. The fields include various filter types such as 'exact', 'gt', 'lt', 'contains', 'iexact', 'isnull', 'in', 'range', etc., for fields like warehouse_name, warehouse_city, warehouse_address, warehouse_contact, creater, create_time, update_time, and more.

In the project, the Filter class is utilized as the filter_class attribute in the APIViewSet and MultipleViewSet classes in the warehouse/views.py file. Both classes are viewsets that handle different actions like retrieving, listing, creating, updating, and deleting data. By setting the filter_class attribute to Filter, the viewsets use the defined filter options to filter the ListModel data based on the specified fields and filter types.

The APIViewSet class also includes methods like create, update, partial_update, and destroy to handle data creation, updating, partial updating, and deletion operations. These methods utilize the Filter class to filter data before performing the respective actions, ensuring that the data manipulation operations adhere to the defined filter options.

Similarly, the MultipleViewSet class in the same file uses the Filter class to filter ListModel data for retrieving and listing purposes. By setting the filter_class attribute to Filter, the class applies the specified filter options when retrieving and listing data, allowing for customized filtering based on the defined fields and filter types.

**Note**:
Developers can customize the filter options for ListModel data by modifying the fields dictionary in the Meta class of the Filter class to include additional fields and filter types as needed.
### ClassDef Meta
**Meta**: The function of Meta is to define metadata options for the ListModel class, specifying database table name, verbose names, and ordering.

**attributes**:
- model: ListModel
- fields: A dictionary containing field names as keys and corresponding lookup types as values.

**Code Description**:
The Meta class within the ListModel class in models.py serves to provide metadata options for the ListModel class. It defines the model as ListModel, which represents the warehouse information model, and specifies various fields with their corresponding lookup types. The fields attribute contains a dictionary where each key represents a field name from the ListModel class, and the associated value is a list of lookup types applicable to that field. This metadata configuration allows for customization of database table names, verbose names, and ordering of query results related to the ListModel class.

**Note**:
Developers can leverage the Meta class to tailor the behavior of the ListModel class in terms of database table naming, verbose naming, and result ordering. By utilizing the fields attribute, developers can define the supported lookup types for each field, enabling precise querying and filtering operations on warehouse data. It is essential to understand and utilize these metadata options effectively to enhance the functionality and performance of the ListModel class within the application.
