## ClassDef Migration
**Migration**: The function of Migration is to define a migration operation for creating a database model.

**attributes**:
- initial: A boolean attribute indicating if this migration is the initial one.
- dependencies: A list of dependencies for the migration.
- operations: A list of database operations to be executed during the migration.

**Code Description**:
The Migration class inherits from migrations.Migration and defines a migration operation that creates a database model named 'ListModel'. The 'ListModel' model contains fields such as 'id', 'goods_brand', 'creater', 'openid', 'is_delete', 'create_time', and 'update_time'. These fields specify the characteristics of the model, such as field types, default values, and verbose names. Additionally, options like 'verbose_name', 'verbose_name_plural', 'db_table', and 'ordering' are set to customize the behavior of the model.

**Note**: When using this Migration class, ensure that the dependencies are correctly specified if there are any, and review the operations to understand the database changes that will be applied during the migration process.
