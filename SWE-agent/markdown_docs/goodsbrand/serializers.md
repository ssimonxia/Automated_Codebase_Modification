## ClassDef GoodsbrandGetSerializer
**GoodsbrandGetSerializer**: The function of GoodsbrandGetSerializer is to serialize the data related to goods brands with specific read-only and required attributes.

**attributes**:
- goods_brand: CharField with read-only and not required properties.
- creater: CharField with read-only and not required properties.
- create_time: DateTimeField with read-only properties and formatted as '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'.
- update_time: DateTimeField with read-only properties and formatted as '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'.

**Code Description**:
The GoodsbrandGetSerializer class is a serializer that inherits from the ModelSerializer class provided by Django REST framework. It defines the serialization behavior for goods brand data, specifying the fields to be included and their characteristics. The 'goods_brand', 'creater', 'create_time', and 'update_time' fields are defined with read-only set to True and required set to False. The 'create_time' and 'update_time' fields are formatted to display the date and time in a specific format.

This serializer class is associated with the ListModel model through the Meta class, where certain fields like 'openid', 'is_delete' are excluded from serialization, and fields like 'id', 'openid', 'appid', 'create_time', 'update_time' are marked as read-only.

In the project, this serializer class is utilized in the APIViewSet class within the get_serializer_class method. Depending on the action performed (list, retrieve, destroy, create, update, partial_update), different serializer classes are returned. For the 'list', 'retrieve', and 'destroy' actions, the GoodsbrandGetSerializer is returned, ensuring the appropriate serialization of goods brand data.

**Note**:
Developers using this serializer should be aware of the read-only nature of certain fields and the specific formatting of date and time fields. When implementing API endpoints that require serialization of goods brand data, this serializer class can be used to ensure consistent and accurate data representation.
### ClassDef Meta
**Meta**: The function of Meta is to provide metadata options for the GoodsbrandGetSerializer class.

**attributes**: 
- model: Specifies the model to be used in the serializer.
- exclude: Specifies which fields to exclude from the serialization process.
- read_only_fields: Specifies which fields should be treated as read-only during serialization.

**Code Description**: 
The Meta class in the GoodsbrandGetSerializer defines metadata options for the serializer. 
- The 'model' attribute is set to ListModel, indicating the model to be used for serialization.
- The 'exclude' attribute lists the fields ['openid', 'is_delete'] that should be excluded from the serialization process.
- The 'read_only_fields' attribute specifies the fields ['id', 'openid', 'appid', 'create_time', 'update_time'] that should be treated as read-only, meaning they will not be included in the writable fields for deserialization.

**Note**: 
Developers can customize the behavior of the serializer by modifying the attributes of the Meta class according to their specific requirements.

## ClassDef GoodsbrandPostSerializer
**GoodsbrandPostSerializer**: The function of GoodsbrandPostSerializer is to serialize and validate the data for creating a new goods brand entry.

**attributes**:
- openid: A string field for the openid of the user creating the goods brand.
- goods_brand: A string field for the name of the goods brand (required).
- creater: A string field for the creator of the goods brand entry (required).

**Code Description**:
The GoodsbrandPostSerializer class extends the ModelSerializer class from the serializers module. It defines three fields: openid, goods_brand, and creater. The openid field is not required and can be modified, while the goods_brand and creater fields are required. Each field has specific validators attached to it for data validation. The Meta class specifies the model to be used and excludes the 'is_delete' field from serialization. Additionally, it sets the 'id', 'create_time', and 'update_time' fields as read-only.

This serializer is used in the project by the APIViewSet classes to handle different actions such as creating, updating, retrieving, and listing goods brand entries. The get_serializer_class method in the views.py file determines which serializer to use based on the action performed. When creating a new goods brand entry, the GoodsbrandPostSerializer is utilized to validate and serialize the incoming data.

**Note**: The GoodsbrandPostSerializer class plays a crucial role in validating and serializing data for creating new goods brand entries in the system.
### ClassDef Meta
**Meta**: The function of Meta is to define metadata options for the GoodsbrandPostSerializer class.

**attributes**: 
- model: Specifies the model to be used for the serializer.
- exclude: Defines a list of fields to be excluded from the serialization process.
- read_only_fields: Specifies a list of fields that should be read-only during serialization.

**Code Description**: 
The Meta class in the GoodsbrandPostSerializer defines the metadata options for the serializer. 
- The 'model' attribute is set to ListModel, indicating the model that the serializer will be based on.
- The 'exclude' attribute is set to ['is_delete', ] which specifies that the 'is_delete' field should be excluded from the serialization process.
- The 'read_only_fields' attribute is set to ['id', 'create_time', 'update_time', ] indicating that these fields should be read-only and not be allowed to be modified during serialization.

**Note**: It is important to carefully define the metadata options in the Meta class to control the behavior of the serializer effectively.

## ClassDef GoodsbrandUpdateSerializer
**GoodsbrandUpdateSerializer**: The function of GoodsbrandUpdateSerializer is to serialize and validate the data for updating goods brand information.

**attributes**:
- goods_brand: A CharField that is read-write and required for the goods brand.
- creater: A CharField that is read-write and required for the creator of the goods brand.

**Code Description**:
The GoodsbrandUpdateSerializer class is a subclass of the ModelSerializer provided by Django REST framework. It defines two fields, goods_brand and creater, both of which are CharFields. These fields are set as read-write and required for updating the goods brand information. The goods_brand field is validated using a custom validator data_validate from datasolve module. 

Within the Meta class, the model attribute is set to ListModel, and the exclude attribute specifies fields that should be excluded from the serialization process ('openid', 'is_delete'). Additionally, the read_only_fields attribute lists fields that should be read-only during updates ('id', 'create_time', 'update_time').

This serializer class is used for updating goods brand information in the project. It ensures that the provided data is validated before updating the corresponding records in the database.

**Note**:
Developers using this serializer should ensure that the data provided for goods_brand and creater fields pass the validation criteria set by the data_validate function in the datasolve module.
