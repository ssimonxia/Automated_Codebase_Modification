## ClassDef ListModel
**ListModel**: The function of ListModel is to define a model for storing information about goods brands.

**attributes**: 
- goods_brand: a CharField to store the name of the goods brand.
- creater: a CharField to store the creator of the goods brand.
- openid: a CharField to store the openid related to the goods brand.
- is_delete: a BooleanField to indicate if the goods brand is marked for deletion.
- create_time: a DateTimeField to store the creation time of the goods brand.
- update_time: a DateTimeField to store the last update time of the goods brand.

**Code Description**: 
The ListModel class defines a model with various fields to store information about goods brands. The 'goods_brand', 'creater', 'openid', 'is_delete', 'create_time', and 'update_time' fields are used to capture the name, creator, openid, deletion status, creation time, and last update time of a goods brand respectively. The Meta class within ListModel specifies metadata such as the database table name, verbose names, and default ordering based on the 'goods_brand' field.

**Note**: 
Developers can use the ListModel class to create instances representing different goods brands in the system. The fields provided offer flexibility in storing and managing information related to goods brands. When querying or working with goods brand data, developers can leverage the attributes defined in ListModel to access and manipulate the stored information effectively.
### ClassDef Meta
**Meta**: The function of Meta is to define metadata options for the ListModel class.

**attributes**:
- db_table: Specifies the database table name for the model.
- verbose_name: Sets a human-readable name for the model.
- verbose_name_plural: Sets a human-readable plural name for the model.
- ordering: Defines the default ordering for query sets of this model.

**Code Description**:
The Meta class in the ListModel class is used to provide metadata options for the model. In this specific implementation, the db_table attribute is set to 'goodsbrand', which specifies the database table name for the model. The verbose_name attribute is set to 'Goods Brand', which provides a human-readable name for the model. The verbose_name_plural attribute is set to "Goods Brand", which gives a human-readable plural name for the model. Lastly, the ordering attribute is set to ['goods_brand'], which defines the default ordering for query sets of this model based on the 'goods_brand' field.

**Note**:
Developers can customize the Meta class in a model to provide various metadata options for the model, such as database table name, verbose names, and default ordering. These options help in organizing and displaying data effectively in the application.
