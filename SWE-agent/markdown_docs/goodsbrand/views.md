## ClassDef APIViewSet
**APIViewSet**: The function of APIViewSet is to provide CRUD operations for the ListModel data, along with filtering and pagination functionalities.

**attributes**:
- pagination_class: MyPageNumberPagination
- filter_backends: [DjangoFilterBackend, OrderingFilter]
- ordering_fields: ['id', "create_time", "update_time"]
- filter_class: Filter

**Code Description**:
The `APIViewSet` class extends `viewsets.ModelViewSet` to handle various HTTP methods for interacting with the ListModel data. It includes methods for retrieving, creating, updating, partially updating, and deleting data. The class utilizes pagination, filtering, and ordering features to manage data efficiently.

The `get_project` method retrieves the project ID from the request parameters. The `get_queryset` method filters the ListModel data based on the user and project ID, ensuring data security. The `get_serializer_class` method selects the appropriate serializer based on the action performed.

The `create`, `update`, `partial_update`, and `destroy` methods handle the corresponding CRUD operations. They validate the data, perform necessary checks, save the data, and return the response with appropriate status codes.

The class also specifies the pagination, filter backends, ordering fields, and filter class to enhance data retrieval and manipulation capabilities.

The `APIViewSet` class interacts with the `Filter` class for defining filter options and the `MyPageNumberPagination` class for pagination settings, enabling efficient data handling within the API.

**Note**: Developers can customize the serializer classes, pagination settings, and filter options to tailor the API behavior according to specific requirements.

**Output Example**:
A response containing serialized data with appropriate headers and status code.
### FunctionDef get_project(self)
**get_project**: The function of get_project is to retrieve the 'pk' value from the kwargs attribute of the object and return it.

**parameters**:
- self: The reference to the current instance of the class.

**Code Description**:
The get_project function attempts to retrieve the 'pk' value from the kwargs attribute of the object. If successful, it returns the 'pk' value; otherwise, it returns None.

In the calling object get_queryset, the get_project function is utilized to obtain the 'id' value. Depending on the existence of the 'id' value and the user authentication status, the function filters and returns specific ListModel objects.

**Note**:
- The get_project function is designed to handle exceptions and return None if an error occurs during the retrieval of the 'pk' value.

**Output Example**:
If the 'pk' value is successfully retrieved and is equal to 1, the function will return 1.
***
### FunctionDef get_queryset(self)
**get_queryset**: The function of get_queryset is to filter and return specific ListModel objects based on the 'id' value and user authentication status.

**parameters**:
- self: The reference to the current instance of the class.

**Code Description**:
The get_queryset function first calls the get_project function to retrieve the 'id' value. It then checks the user authentication status and filters ListModel objects accordingly. If the 'id' is None, it filters objects based on the 'openid' and 'is_delete' fields. If the 'id' is not None, it filters objects based on 'openid', 'id', and 'is_delete' fields. If the user is not authenticated, it returns an empty queryset.

**Note**:
- The function relies on the get_project function to obtain the 'id' value.
- It handles different scenarios based on the 'id' value and user authentication status.

**Output Example**:
If the 'id' is 1 and the user is authenticated, the function will return ListModel.objects.filter(openid=self.request.auth.openid, id=1, is_delete=False).
***
### FunctionDef get_serializer_class(self)
**get_serializer_class**: The function of get_serializer_class is to determine the appropriate serializer class based on the action being performed in the APIViewSet.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.
  
**Code Description**:
The get_serializer_class method in the APIViewSet class checks the action being performed (list, retrieve, destroy, create, update, partial_update) and returns the corresponding serializer class based on the action. If the action is 'list', 'retrieve', or 'destroy', it returns the GoodsbrandGetSerializer. For 'create', it returns the GoodsbrandPostSerializer. If the action is 'update', the GoodsbrandUpdateSerializer is returned, and for 'partial_update', the GoodsbrandPartialUpdateSerializer is returned. In case of an unknown action, it calls the http_method_not_allowed method.

This method ensures that the appropriate serializer is used for each action to handle the serialization and validation of goods brand data effectively within the APIViewSet class.

**Note**:
Developers should be aware of the action-based serializer selection logic in the get_serializer_class method to ensure the correct serialization behavior for different API actions.

**Output Example**:
- If the action is 'list', the method returns GoodsbrandGetSerializer.
- If the action is 'create', the method returns GoodsbrandPostSerializer.
- If the action is 'update', the method returns GoodsbrandUpdateSerializer.
- If the action is 'partial_update', the method returns GoodsbrandPartialUpdateSerializer.

### FunctionDef create(self, request)
**create**: The function of create is to handle the creation of a new instance of a model with specific validation checks.

**parameters**:
- request: The HTTP request object.
- *args: Additional positional arguments.
- **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments.

**Code Description**:
The create function first retrieves the request data and adds the 'openid' field from the authentication data. It then checks if an existing record with the same 'openid' and 'goods_brand' values exists in the ListModel. If the record exists, it raises an APIException with a message indicating that the data already exists. If the record does not exist, it proceeds to serialize the data, perform validation, save the serializer data, and return a response with a success status code along with headers.

**Note**:
- This function assumes the existence of a ListModel for data storage and retrieval.
- The function relies on the presence of authentication data to populate the 'openid' field.
- It enforces data uniqueness based on 'openid' and 'goods_brand' fields in the ListModel.
- The function uses serializer for data validation and saving.

**Output Example**:
{
    "id": 1,
    "goods_brand": "Example Brand",
    "other_field": "Other data",
    "openid": "example_openid",
    "is_delete": false
}
***
### FunctionDef update(self, request, pk)
**update**: The function of update is to update a specific object instance.

**parameters**:
- request: Represents the request made to update the object.
- pk: Represents the primary key of the object to be updated.

**Code Description**:
The update function first retrieves the object to be updated using the get_object method. It then checks if the openid of the object matches the openid of the authenticated request. If they do not match, an APIException is raised indicating that the data cannot be updated as it does not belong to the requester. If the openids match, the function proceeds to update the object with the data provided in the request. The data is validated using the serializer, and if valid, the changes are saved. Finally, the function returns a response with the updated data and a success status code along with the appropriate headers.

**Note**:
- This function ensures that only the owner of the data can update it.
- It relies on serializers for data validation and saving changes.
- Proper authentication and authorization mechanisms should be in place to prevent unauthorized updates.

**Output Example**:
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Updated Name",
    "description": "Updated Description"
}
***
### FunctionDef partial_update(self, request, pk)
**partial_update**: The function of partial_update is to partially update an object based on the provided data if the authenticated user is the owner of the object.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.
- request: The request object containing metadata about the request.
- pk: The primary key of the object to be updated.

**Code Description**:
The partial_update function first retrieves the object to be updated using the get_object method. It then checks if the authenticated user's openid matches the openid associated with the object. If they do not match, an APIException is raised indicating that the data cannot be updated as it does not belong to the user. If the openids match, the function proceeds to extract the data from the request, initialize a serializer with the partial data, validate the serializer, save the updated data, and return a response with the updated data along with a success status and headers.

**Note**:
It is crucial to ensure that the authentication mechanism is in place to verify the ownership of the data before calling this function to prevent unauthorized updates.

**Output Example**:
{
    "field1": "updated_value1",
    "field2": "updated_value2",
    ...
}
***
### FunctionDef destroy(self, request, pk)
**destroy**: The function of destroy is to delete a specific object after checking if the requesting user has the permission to delete it.

**parameters**:
- request: Represents the request made by the user.
- pk: Represents the primary key of the object to be deleted.

**Code Description**:
The destroy function first retrieves the object to be deleted using the get_object method. It then checks if the openid of the object matches the openid of the requesting user. If they do not match, an APIException is raised with a message indicating that the data cannot be deleted as it does not belong to the user. If the openids match, the is_delete field of the object is set to True, and the object is saved. The function then serializes the updated object, retrieves the success headers, and returns a response with the serialized data and a status code of 200.

**Note**: This function ensures that only the user who owns the data can delete it, preventing unauthorized deletion of objects.

**Output Example**:
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Example",
    "is_delete": true
}
