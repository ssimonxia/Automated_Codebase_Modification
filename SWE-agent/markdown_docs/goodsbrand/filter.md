## ClassDef Filter
**Filter**: The function of Filter is to define filter options for the ListModel data based on specific fields.

**attributes**:
- model: ListModel
- fields: A dictionary containing field names as keys and a list of filter options as values.

**Code Description**:
The `Filter` class is a subclass of `FilterSet` that provides filter options for the `ListModel` data. It defines filter options for fields such as "id", "goods_brand", "creater", "is_delete", "create_time", and "update_time". Each field has a list of filter options that can be applied to query the data.

In the `goodsbrand/views.py/APIViewSet` file, the `Filter` class is set as the `filter_class` attribute of the `APIViewSet` class. This allows the `APIViewSet` to use the filter options defined in the `Filter` class when filtering the `ListModel` data.

The `Filter` class plays a crucial role in enabling the `APIViewSet` to filter and retrieve specific data based on the defined filter options. By specifying the filter options in the `Filter` class, developers can easily query and retrieve relevant data from the `ListModel`.

**Note**: Developers can customize the filter options for each field in the `Filter` class to suit the specific filtering requirements of the `ListModel` data.
### ClassDef Meta
**Meta**: The function of Meta is to define metadata options for the Filter class.

**attributes**: 
- model: Specifies the model to be used for filtering.
- fields: Defines the fields along with their lookup types for filtering.

**Code Description**:
The Meta class within the Filter class is used to provide metadata options for filtering data. The 'model' attribute specifies the model to be used for filtering, while the 'fields' attribute is a dictionary that defines the fields of the model along with the lookup types that can be applied to each field for filtering. Each field is associated with a list of lookup types such as 'exact', 'iexact', 'contains', 'icontains', 'gt', 'gte', 'lt', 'lte', 'isnull', 'in', 'range', 'year', 'month', 'day', and 'week_day'.

**Note**: When using the Meta class, ensure that the 'model' attribute is set to the appropriate model for filtering, and define the fields along with their corresponding lookup types accurately to achieve the desired filtering functionality.
