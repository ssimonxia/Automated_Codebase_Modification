## ClassDef ListModel
**ListModel**: The function of ListModel is to define a model representing a list of goods with various attributes such as goods code, description, supplier, weight, dimensions, volume, unit, class, brand, color, shape, specifications, origin, stock, cost, price, creator information, bar code, timestamps, and deletion status.

**attributes**:
- goods_code: CharField
- goods_desc: CharField
- goods_supplier: CharField
- goods_weight: FloatField
- goods_w: FloatField
- goods_d: FloatField
- goods_h: FloatField
- unit_volume: FloatField
- goods_unit: CharField
- goods_class: CharField
- goods_brand: CharField
- goods_color: CharField
- goods_shape: CharField
- goods_specs: CharField
- goods_origin: CharField
- safety_stock: BigIntegerField
- goods_cost: FloatField
- goods_price: FloatField
- creater: CharField
- bar_code: CharField
- openid: CharField
- is_delete: BooleanField
- create_time: DateTimeField
- update_time: DateTimeField

**Code Description**:
The ListModel class defines a model in Django ORM representing a list of goods with various attributes. The model includes fields for goods details such as code, description, supplier, weight, dimensions, volume, unit, class, brand, color, shape, specifications, origin, stock, cost, price, creator information, bar code, timestamps for creation and update, and a field to indicate deletion status. The Meta class within ListModel specifies the database table name, verbose names, and ordering of the records.

This ListModel class is utilized in various parts of the project:
- In goods/filter.py, the Meta class of the Filter class specifies the model as ListModel and defines filter fields based on the attributes of ListModel.
- In goods/serializers.py, multiple serializer classes (GoodsGetSerializer, GoodsPostSerializer, GoodsUpdateSerializer, GoodsPartialUpdateSerializer, FileRenderSerializer) use ListModel as the model and define Meta classes with specific configurations for serialization.
- In goods/views.py, ListModel is used in different methods such as get_queryset, create, and get_success_headers to interact with the database and perform operations related to goods data.

**Note**:
Developers can use the ListModel class to represent goods data in the project, customize serialization behavior with serializer classes, and interact with goods data in views for various operations like querying, creating, and downloading.
### ClassDef Meta
**Meta**: The function of Meta is to define metadata options for the ListModel class.

**attributes**:
- db_table: Specifies the database table name for the model.
- verbose_name: Sets a human-readable name for the model in singular form.
- verbose_name_plural: Sets a human-readable name for the model in plural form.
- ordering: Defines the default ordering for query sets of the model.

**Code Description**:
The Meta class in the ListModel class is used to provide metadata options for the model. In this specific implementation:
- The db_table attribute is set to 'goods', indicating the database table name for the model.
- The verbose_name attribute is set to 'Goods List', providing a human-readable name for the model in singular form.
- The verbose_name_plural attribute is set to "Goods List", offering a human-readable name for the model in plural form.
- The ordering attribute is set to ['-id'], specifying the default ordering for query sets of the model based on the 'id' field in descending order.

**Note**:
Developers can customize the Meta class in the ListModel to define various metadata options for the model, such as database table name, verbose names, and default ordering. These options help in organizing and presenting the model data effectively within the application.
