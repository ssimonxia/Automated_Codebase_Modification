## ClassDef Filter
**Filter**: The Filter class is a subclass of the FilterSet class and is used for filtering data based on specified fields and their corresponding lookup options.

**Attributes**:
- `model`: Specifies the model on which the filtering is applied.
- `fields`: Defines the fields and their corresponding lookup options for filtering.

**Code Description**:
The Filter class is designed to provide a convenient way to filter data based on specific fields and their lookup options. It inherits from the FilterSet class, which provides the basic functionality for filtering data.

The `model` attribute specifies the model on which the filtering is applied. In this case, the model is `ListModel`.

The `fields` attribute defines the fields and their corresponding lookup options for filtering. Each field is represented as a key-value pair, where the key is the field name and the value is a list of lookup options. The lookup options determine how the field is filtered, such as exact match, case-insensitive match, greater than, less than, etc.

The Filter class is used in conjunction with other classes and functions in the project to filter data based on user-defined criteria. For example, it is used in the `SannerGoodsTagView` class to filter goods based on their barcode. It is also used in the `APIViewSet` class to filter goods based on various criteria such as shape, specs, and search keyword.

The `Filter` class provides a flexible and customizable way to filter data in the project. By defining the fields and their lookup options, developers can easily implement filtering functionality based on specific requirements.

**Note**:
- The `Filter` class should be used as a subclass and customized according to specific filtering needs.
- The `model` attribute should be set to the appropriate model on which the filtering is applied.
- The `fields` attribute should be defined with the desired fields and their corresponding lookup options for filtering.
### ClassDef Meta
**Meta**: The function of Meta is to define metadata options for the ListModel class, including the model, fields, and ordering of records.

**attributes**:
- model: Represents the model associated with the metadata.
- fields: Defines a dictionary with field names as keys and a list of lookup types as values.
  
**Code Description**:
The Meta class within the ListModel class in Django ORM serves to provide metadata options for the model. In this specific implementation, the Meta class specifies the model as ListModel and defines a dictionary of fields with associated lookup types. These fields and lookup types are utilized for filtering data when querying the ListModel records. Additionally, the Meta class sets the ordering of records based on the 'id' field in descending order.

The Meta class plays a crucial role in configuring how the ListModel class interacts with the database, particularly in terms of defining the structure of the model, specifying filterable fields, and determining the default ordering of retrieved records.

**Note**:
Developers can leverage the Meta class to customize the behavior of the ListModel class, such as specifying the model, defining filterable fields with specific lookup types, and setting the default ordering of records. This customization enhances the flexibility and functionality of the ListModel class when working with goods data in the project.
