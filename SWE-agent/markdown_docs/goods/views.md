**Code Description**:
The `SannerGoodsTagView` class provides various methods to handle different actions such as retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting goods data.

The `get_project` method retrieves the 'bar_code' parameter from the URL kwargs and returns it. If the parameter is not present, it returns None.

The `get_queryset` method retrieves the 'bar_code' parameter using the `get_project` method. It then checks if the user is authenticated. If the user is authenticated, it filters the goods data based on the 'openid', 'bar_code', and 'is_delete' conditions. If the user is not authenticated, it returns an empty queryset.

The `get_serializer_class` method determines the serializer class to be used based on the current action. It returns the appropriate serializer class based on the action type.

The `retrieve` method handles the retrieval of a single goods object. It retrieves the 'asn_code' parameter from the request query parameters. It then retrieves the goods object using the `get_object` method and serializes it using the appropriate serializer class. It also retrieves the corresponding goods detail object based on the 'asn_code' and 'goods_code' fields. If the goods detail object does not exist, it raises an APIException. Otherwise, it constructs a response context with the goods detail information and returns it.

**Note**:

The `get_project` method retrieves the project ID from the URL parameters and returns it. It is used to get the project ID for filtering data.

The `get_queryset` method is overridden to provide a custom queryset for retrieving goods data. It first calls the `get_project` method to get the project ID. If the user is authenticated, it retrieves the search keyword from the request parameters. If a search keyword is provided, it filters the data based on the keyword and the project ID (if available). Otherwise, it filters the data based on the project ID only. The method returns the filtered queryset.

The `get_serializer_class` method is overridden to provide a custom serializer class based on the action being performed. It returns different serializer classes based on the action, such as GoodsGetSerializer for list, retrieve, and destroy actions, GoodsPostSerializer for create action, GoodsUpdateSerializer for update action, and GoodsPartialUpdateSerializer for partial_update action.

The `create` method is overridden to handle the creation of a new goods data line. It first retrieves the data from the request and adds the authenticated user's openid and calculates the unit volume based on the goods dimensions. It then checks if the data already exists based on the openid and goods code. If it exists, an APIException is raised. Otherwise, it checks if the related models (supplier, goods_unit, goods_class, goods_brand, goods_color, goods_shape, goods_specs, goods_origin) exist based on the openid and their respective fields. If any of the related models do not exist or have been changed, an APIException is raised. If all the checks pass, the data is saved and a success response is returned.

The `update` method is overridden to handle the update of an existing goods data line. It first retrieves the goods object to be updated. If the openid of the goods object does not match the authenticated user's openid, an APIException is raised. Otherwise, it retrieves the data from the request and calculates the unit volume based on the goods dimensions. It then checks if the related models exist and have not been changed. If any of the checks fail, an APIException is raised. If all the checks pass, the data is updated and a success response is returned.

The `partial_update` method is overridden to handle the partial update of an existing goods data line. It follows a similar process as the `update` method, but allows only partial updates of the data.

The `destroy` method is overridden to handle the deletion of an existing goods data line. It first retrieves the goods object to be deleted. If the openid of the goods object does not match the authenticated user's openid, an APIException is raised. Otherwise, the is_delete field of the goods object is set to True, and the object is saved. A success response is returned.

**Note**:
- This class should be used as the viewset for goods-related API views.

**Note**:
Developers should ensure that the FileRenderSerializer class is properly defined and accessible within the project to handle goods data serialization effectively.
Proper handling of queryset filtering and data rendering is essential for generating accurate CSV files with goods information for download.

**Output Example**:
A CSV file named 'goodslist_20220101120000.csv' containing serialized goods data for download.
