## ClassDef GoodsoriginGetSerializer
**GoodsoriginGetSerializer**: The function of GoodsoriginGetSerializer is to serialize the data related to goods origin with specific read-only and required attributes.

**attributes**: 
- goods_origin: CharField with read-only and not required properties.
- creater: CharField with read-only and not required properties.
- create_time: DateTimeField with read-only properties and date-time format.
- update_time: DateTimeField with read-only properties and date-time format.

**Code Description**: 
The GoodsoriginGetSerializer class is a ModelSerializer that defines the serialization behavior for the goods origin data. It includes fields like goods_origin, creater, create_time, and update_time with specific read-only and required properties. The Meta class inside the serializer specifies the model to be used, excludes certain fields like openid and is_delete, and sets read-only fields such as id, openid, appid, create_time, and update_time.

This serializer is utilized in the project's APIViewSet to determine the serializer class based on different actions. In the get_serializer_class method, the GoodsoriginGetSerializer is returned when the action is 'list', 'retrieve', or 'destroy'. This ensures that the appropriate serializer is used for these actions to handle goods origin data serialization.

**Note**: 
Developers can use GoodsoriginGetSerializer to serialize goods origin data with specific read-only and required attributes. Ensure to set the appropriate read-only and required properties for each field based on the serialization requirements.
### ClassDef Meta
**Meta**: The function of Meta is to define metadata options for the GoodsoriginGetSerializer class.

**attributes**: 
- model: Specifies the model class to be used by the serializer.
- exclude: Defines a list of fields to be excluded from the serialized output.
- read_only_fields: Specifies a list of fields that should be read-only during deserialization.

**Code Description**:
The Meta class in the GoodsoriginGetSerializer defines metadata options for the serializer. The 'model' attribute is set to ListModel, indicating the model class to be used by the serializer. The 'exclude' attribute contains a list of fields ('openid', 'is_delete') that will be excluded from the serialized output. Additionally, the 'read_only_fields' attribute includes fields ('id', 'openid', 'appid', 'create_time', 'update_time') that are designated as read-only during deserialization.
