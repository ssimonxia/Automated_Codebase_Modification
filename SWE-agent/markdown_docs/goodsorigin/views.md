### FunctionDef get_project(self)
**get_project**: The function of get_project is to retrieve the 'pk' value from the kwargs attribute of the object and return it.

**parameters**: 
- self: The reference to the current instance of the class.

**Code Description**: 
The get_project function attempts to retrieve the 'pk' value from the kwargs attribute of the object. If successful, it returns the 'pk' value; otherwise, it returns None. This function is used to extract the 'pk' value which is typically used to identify a specific project.

In the calling object get_queryset, the get_project function is invoked to obtain the 'id' value. Depending on the presence of the 'id' value and the user authentication status, different queries are executed on the ListModel objects to filter and return specific data.

**Note**: 
It is important to handle exceptions appropriately when using the get_project function to ensure smooth execution and error handling.

**Output Example**: 
If 'pk' value is present in the kwargs attribute, the function may return 123 (assuming 'pk' is 123).

### FunctionDef get_queryset(self)
**get_queryset**: The function of get_queryset is to filter and return data from the ListModel objects based on the 'id' value, user authentication status, and other conditions.

**parameters**: 
- self: The reference to the current instance of the class.

**Code Description**: 
The get_queryset function first calls the get_project function to retrieve the 'id' value. It then checks the user authentication status and filters the ListModel objects accordingly. If the user is authenticated and 'id' is present, it filters by 'openid', 'id', and 'is_delete' fields. If the user is not authenticated, it returns an empty queryset. This function is crucial for fetching specific data based on user authentication and 'id' values.

In the context of the project, get_queryset is a method within the APIViewSet class that handles the logic for retrieving and filtering data from the ListModel objects. By utilizing the get_project function to extract the 'id' value, get_queryset ensures that only relevant data is returned based on the user's authentication status and specific 'id' values.

**Note**: 
It is essential to ensure that the get_project function is functioning correctly to retrieve the 'id' value accurately. Proper handling of user authentication and 'id' values is necessary to retrieve the desired data from the ListModel objects.

**Output Example**: 
If the user is authenticated and 'id' is present, the function may return a queryset containing specific data from the ListModel objects.

### FunctionDef get_serializer_class(self)

### FunctionDef create(self, request)
**create**: The function of create is to handle the creation of a new instance of a model with specific validation checks.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.
- request: The request object containing the data.
- *args: Additional positional arguments.
- **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments.

**Code Description**:
The create function first retrieves the data from the request object. It then adds the 'openid' value from the request's authentication information to the data. Subsequently, it checks if an instance with the same 'openid' and 'goods_origin' values already exists in the ListModel. If the instance exists, it raises an APIException with a message indicating that the data already exists. If the instance does not exist, it proceeds to create a serializer with the provided data, validates the serializer, saves the data, retrieves success headers, and returns a response with the serialized data and a status code of 200.

**Note**:
- This function assumes the existence of a ListModel for data storage and retrieval.
- The function relies on proper authentication to access the 'openid' value.
- It is crucial to handle the APIException appropriately when using this function.

**Output Example**:
{
    "id": 1,
    "goods_origin": "example_origin",
    "other_field": "value",
    ...
}
***
### FunctionDef update(self, request, pk)
**update**: The function of update is to update a specific object instance with the provided data if certain conditions are met.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.
- request: The request object containing metadata about the request.
- pk: The primary key of the object to be updated.

**Code Description**:
The update function first retrieves the object to be updated using the get_object method. It then checks if the openid of the object matches the openid of the authenticated user making the request. If they do not match, an APIException is raised with a message indicating that the data cannot be updated as it does not belong to the user.

Next, the function retrieves the data from the request object. It checks if there is an existing object in the ListModel with the same openid, goods_origin, and is_delete status. If such an object exists, an APIException is raised with a message indicating that the data already exists.

If the data passes the validation checks, the function proceeds to serialize the updated data using the get_serializer method. The serializer is then validated, and if valid, the changes are saved. Finally, the function generates success headers, constructs a response with the serialized data, and returns it with a status code of 200.

**Note**:
- This function assumes the presence of a get_object method to retrieve the object to be updated.
- The function relies on the existence of a ListModel to check for the presence of similar data before updating.
- The use of APIException suggests that this function is part of an API viewset and is likely handling RESTful API requests.

**Output Example**:
```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "goods_origin": "Updated Origin",
    "other_field": "Updated Value"
}
```
***
### FunctionDef partial_update(self, request, pk)
**partial_update**: The function of partial_update is to partially update an object based on the provided data if the object belongs to the authenticated user.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.
- request: The request object containing metadata about the request.
- pk: The primary key of the object to be updated.

**Code Description**:
The partial_update function first retrieves the object to be updated using the get_object method. It then checks if the openid of the object matches the openid of the authenticated user. If not, it raises an APIException indicating that the data cannot be updated as it does not belong to the user. If the object belongs to the user, the function proceeds to extract the data from the request, initialize a serializer with partial update capability, validate the data, save the updated data, and return a response with the updated data and a success status code.

**Note**:
It is crucial to ensure that the authentication mechanism is in place to prevent unauthorized updates to objects.

**Output Example**:
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Updated Name",
    "description": "Updated Description"
}
***
### FunctionDef destroy(self, request, pk)
**destroy**: The function of destroy is to delete a specific object if the authenticated user is the owner of that object.

**parameters**:
- request: Represents the request made to the API.
- pk: Represents the primary key of the object to be deleted.

**Code Description**:
The destroy function first retrieves the object to be deleted using the get_object method. It then checks if the openid of the authenticated user matches the openid associated with the object. If they do not match, an APIException is raised with a message indicating that the data cannot be deleted as it does not belong to the user. If the openids match, the is_delete field of the object is set to True, and the object is saved. The function then serializes the updated object, generates success headers, and returns a response with the serialized data and a status code of 200.

**Note**:
- This function assumes that the API request is authenticated.
- The function relies on the get_object, get_serializer, and get_success_headers methods being defined in the APIViewSet class.

**Output Example**:
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Example Object",
    "is_delete": true
}
