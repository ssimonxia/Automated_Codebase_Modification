## ClassDef Migration
**Migration**: The function of Migration is to create a migration for the 'goodsorigin' app, which includes creating a model named 'ListModel' with specific fields and options.

**attributes**: 
- initial: A boolean attribute set to True indicating that this migration is the initial one.
- dependencies: A list of dependencies for the migration.
- operations: A list of operations to be performed during the migration, in this case, creating a model.

**Code Description**:
The Migration class inherits from migrations.Migration and defines the initial attribute as True. It specifies an empty list for dependencies and includes operations to create a model named 'ListModel'. The 'ListModel' model contains fields such as 'id', 'goods_origin', 'creater', 'openid', 'is_delete', 'create_time', and 'update_time'. These fields are defined using various field types from the models module. Additionally, options for the model include verbose names, table name, ordering, etc.

**Note**: 
Developers can customize the fields and options of the model according to their specific requirements by modifying the fields and options within the migrations.CreateModel operation.
