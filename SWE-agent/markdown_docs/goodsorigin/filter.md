### ClassDef Meta
**Meta**: The function of Meta is to define metadata options for the Filter class.

**attributes**: 
- model: Represents the model to be used for the filter.
- fields: Contains a dictionary where each key represents a field name and its value is a list of lookup types that can be used for filtering that field.

**Code Description**: 
The Meta class within the Filter class is used to specify metadata options. It defines two attributes: model and fields. The model attribute is set to ListModel, indicating the model to be used for filtering. The fields attribute is a dictionary where each key represents a field name in the model, and the corresponding value is a list of lookup types that can be applied to that field for filtering. For example, the "id" field can be filtered using lookup types such as 'exact', 'gt', 'in', etc.

**Note**: 
Developers can customize the fields attribute to specify which fields are filterable and the types of lookups allowed for each field. This provides flexibility in defining filtering options based on the requirements of the application.
