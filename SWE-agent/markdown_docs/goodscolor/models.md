## ClassDef ListModel
**ListModel**: The function of ListModel is to define a model representing goods colors with various attributes such as goods_color, creater, openid, is_delete, create_time, and update_time.

**attributes**:
- goods_color: a CharField to store the color of the goods.
- creater: a CharField to store information about the creator of the goods color.
- openid: a CharField to store the openid related to the goods color.
- is_delete: a BooleanField to indicate if the goods color is marked for deletion.
- create_time: a DateTimeField to store the timestamp of when the goods color was created.
- update_time: a DateTimeField to store the timestamp of the last update to the goods color.

**Code Description**:
The ListModel class is a Django model that inherits from models.Model. It defines the structure of the 'goodscolor' table in the database. The class includes fields like goods_color, creater, openid, is_delete, create_time, and update_time, each specifying the type of data it can hold and additional properties such as maximum length and default values.

The Meta inner class is used to provide metadata for the ListModel class, including the database table name ('goodscolor'), verbose names for better readability, and the default ordering based on the 'goods_color' field.

This ListModel class is utilized in various parts of the project:
- In goodscolor/filter.py, the ListModel is referenced in the Meta class of the Filter class to define filter options for different fields.
- In goodscolor/serializers.py, ListModel is used in multiple serializer classes (GoodscolorGetSerializer, GoodscolorPostSerializer, GoodscolorUpdateSerializer, GoodscolorPartialUpdateSerializer) to specify the model, exclude certain fields, and set read-only fields.
- In goodscolor/views.py, the ListModel is used in the APIViewSet class methods like get_queryset and create to interact with the ListModel data based on user requests.

**Note**:
Developers can use the ListModel class to represent goods colors in the database, customize the metadata using the Meta class, and leverage it in serializers and views for data manipulation and retrieval.
### ClassDef Meta
**Meta**: The function of Meta is to define metadata options for the ListModel class.

**attributes**:
- db_table: Specifies the database table name for the model.
- verbose_name: Sets a human-readable name for the model.
- verbose_name_plural: Sets a human-readable plural name for the model.
- ordering: Defines the default ordering for queries on the model.

**Code Description**:
The Meta class in the ListModel class is used to provide metadata options for the model. In this specific implementation:
- The db_table attribute is set to 'goodscolor', indicating the database table name for the model.
- The verbose_name attribute is set to 'Goods Color', providing a human-readable name for the model.
- The verbose_name_plural attribute is set to "Goods Color", offering a human-readable plural name for the model.
- The ordering attribute is set to ['goods_color'], defining the default ordering for queries on the model based on the 'goods_color' field.

**Note**:
Developers can customize the behavior of the ListModel class by modifying the attributes within the Meta class according to their specific requirements.
