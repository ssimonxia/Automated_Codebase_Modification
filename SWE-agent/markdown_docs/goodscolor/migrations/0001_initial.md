## ClassDef Migration
**Migration**: The function of Migration is to create a migration for the 'goodscolor' app, defining the schema for the 'ListModel' model.

**attributes**:
- initial: A boolean attribute set to True indicating that this is the initial migration.
- dependencies: A list of dependencies for the migration. In this case, it is empty.
- operations: A list of operations to be performed during the migration. In this case, it includes creating a model.

**Code Description**:
The Migration class inherits from migrations.Migration and defines the schema for the 'ListModel' model. It includes fields such as 'id', 'goods_color', 'creater', 'openid', 'is_delete', 'create_time', and 'update_time'. These fields specify the data types and constraints for each field in the model. The options dictionary provides additional configuration for the model, such as verbose names, database table name, and ordering.

The 'CreateModel' operation within the 'operations' list creates a new model named 'ListModel' with the specified fields and options.

**Note**:
Developers can customize the fields and options in the model definition according to their specific requirements.
