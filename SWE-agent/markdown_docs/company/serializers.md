Each field such as openid, company_name, company_city, company_address, company_contact, company_manager, and creater is specified with its characteristics like read-only status, requirement, and validation using the datasolve.data_validate function.

The class Meta inside CompanyPostSerializer specifies the model to be used for serialization (ListModel), excludes certain fields like 'is_delete', and sets read-only fields such as 'id', 'create_time', and 'update_time'.

The fields in the CompanyPostSerializer are validated using the datasolve.data_validate function, which checks for specific data patterns and raises exceptions if the data is invalid.

**Note**: CompanyPostSerializer is utilized in the project by different actions such as create, update, list, retrieve, and destroy to handle company data serialization and validation. The fields are validated using the datasolve.data_validate function to ensure data integrity before storing it in the database.
### ClassDef Meta
**Meta**: The function of Meta is to define metadata options for the CompanyPostSerializer class.

**attributes**: 
- model: Specifies the model that the serializer should be based on, in this case, ListModel.
- exclude: Specifies which fields should be excluded from the serialization process. In this case, 'is_delete' field is excluded.
- read_only_fields: Specifies which fields should be treated as read-only during deserialization and validation. In this case, 'id', 'create_time', and 'update_time' fields are read-only.

**Code Description**:
The Meta class in the CompanyPostSerializer defines the metadata options for the serializer. The 'model' attribute specifies that the serializer should be based on the ListModel model. The 'exclude' attribute specifies that the 'is_delete' field should be excluded from the serialization process. Additionally, the 'read_only_fields' attribute specifies that the 'id', 'create_time', and 'update_time' fields should be treated as read-only during deserialization and validation.

**Note**: It is important to carefully define metadata options in the Meta class to control the behavior of the serializer effectively. Make sure to review and update these options as needed to ensure the serializer functions correctly based on the specified metadata.

## ClassDef CompanyUpdateSerializer
**CompanyUpdateSerializer**: The function of CompanyUpdateSerializer is to serialize and validate the data for updating a company's information.

**attributes**:
- company_name: A character field for the company name.
- company_city: A character field for the company city.
- company_address: A character field for the company address.
- company_contact: A character field for the company contact information.
- company_manager: A character field for the company manager's name.
- creater: A character field for the creator of the company information.

**Code Description**:
The CompanyUpdateSerializer class extends the ModelSerializer class from the serializers module. It defines fields for various company information such as name, city, address, contact, manager, and creator. Each field is specified with read-only set to False and required set to True, indicating that the fields are not read-only and must be provided during data validation. Additionally, each field is associated with a data validation function called data_validate from the datasolve module.

The Meta inner class is used to specify metadata for the serializer. It defines the model as ListModel and excludes certain fields like 'openid', 'is_delete', while setting 'id', 'create_time', and 'update_time' as read-only fields.

The data_validate function is used for data validation within the serializer. It checks for the presence of potentially harmful data such as 'script' or 'select' in the input data. If such data is found, an APIException is raised with an appropriate error message.

**Note**:
It is important to ensure that the data being passed to the CompanyUpdateSerializer is validated properly to prevent any malicious input from being stored in the system. The exclusion of certain fields and the read-only nature of others are defined in the Meta class to control the behavior of the serializer.
### ClassDef Meta
**Meta**: The function of Meta is to define metadata options for the CompanyUpdateSerializer class.

**attributes**: 
- model: Specifies the model that the serializer should be based on (in this case, ListModel).
- exclude: Specifies which fields should be excluded from the serialization process.
- read_only_fields: Specifies which fields should be treated as read-only during deserialization.

**Code Description**:
The Meta class in the CompanyUpdateSerializer defines metadata options for the serializer. The 'model' attribute is set to ListModel, indicating the model that the serializer will be based on. The 'exclude' attribute specifies a list of fields ('openid', 'is_delete') that should be excluded from the serialization process. The 'read_only_fields' attribute specifies a list of fields ('id', 'create_time', 'update_time') that should be treated as read-only during deserialization.

**Note**: It is important to carefully review and update the 'exclude' and 'read_only_fields' attributes based on the specific requirements of the serialization process.
