## ClassDef ListModel
**ListModel**: The function of ListModel is to define a model for staff members with various attributes such as staff name, staff type, check code, openid, deletion status, creation time, update time, error check code counter, and lock status.

**attributes**: 
- staff_name: A CharField to store the name of the staff member.
- staff_type: A CharField to store the type of the staff member.
- check_code: An IntegerField to store a check code with a default value of 8888.
- openid: A CharField to store the openid of the staff member.
- is_delete: A BooleanField to indicate the deletion status of the staff member.
- create_time: A DateTimeField to store the creation time of the staff member.
- update_time: A DateTimeField to store the last update time of the staff member.
- error_check_code_counter: An IntegerField to keep track of the number of error check code attempts.
- is_lock: A BooleanField to determine if the staff member is locked.

**Code Description**: 
The ListModel class represents a model for staff members in the system. It includes various fields such as staff_name, staff_type, check_code, openid, is_delete, create_time, update_time, error_check_code_counter, and is_lock. These fields provide essential information about each staff member, including their name, type, unique identifiers, status, timestamps, and security-related attributes.

The class also includes a Meta inner class that defines metadata for the model, such as the database table name ('staff'), verbose names ('Staff' and 'Staff' plural), and default ordering based on the staff_name field.

**Note**: 
Developers can use this ListModel class as a blueprint for creating and managing staff member objects in the system. They can customize the attributes or add additional fields as needed for their specific application requirements. The Meta class settings help in defining how the model behaves in the database and admin interface.
### ClassDef Meta
**Meta**: The function of Meta is to define metadata options for the ListModel class.

**attributes**:
- db_table: Specifies the database table name for the model.
- verbose_name: Sets a human-readable name for the model.
- verbose_name_plural: Sets a human-readable plural name for the model.
- ordering: Defines the default ordering for query sets of the model.

**Code Description**:
The Meta class in the ListModel defines metadata options for the model. 
- The db_table attribute specifies the name of the database table where the model's data will be stored.
- The verbose_name attribute provides a human-readable name for the model, which can be used in the admin interface or other display purposes.
- The verbose_name_plural attribute sets the plural name for the model, which is useful for displaying multiple instances of the model.
- The ordering attribute defines the default ordering for query sets of the model, ensuring that results are retrieved in a specific order by default.

**Note**:
Developers can customize the behavior of the ListModel class by setting these metadata options in the Meta class. These options help in defining how the model interacts with the database and how it is displayed in the user interface.

## ClassDef TypeListModel
**TypeListModel**: The function of TypeListModel is to define a model for staff types with specific fields and metadata settings.

**attributes**:
- staff_type: A CharField to store the type of staff.
- openid: A CharField to store the unique identifier.
- creater: A CharField to store the creator of the staff type.
- create_time: A DateTimeField to store the creation time.
- update_time: A DateTimeField to store the last update time.

**Code Description**:
The TypeListModel class represents a model in Django ORM for storing staff types. It contains fields such as staff_type, openid, creater, create_time, and update_time. The Meta class within TypeListModel specifies metadata including the database table name, verbose names, and ordering of results based on the staff_type field.

In the project, the TypeListModel class is utilized in the initialization process within the init_category function. This function checks for existing staff types with a specific openid and creates default staff types if they do not exist or do not match the expected count.

Additionally, the TypeListModel class is referenced in the TypeFilter class within the Meta class, defining filter options for querying staff types based on id, staff_type, create_time, and update_time.

Furthermore, the TypeListModel class is associated with the StaffTypeGetSerializer class, where the Meta class specifies the model and excludes the openid field from serialization.

Lastly, the TypeListModel class is used in the TypeAPIViewSet to filter and retrieve staff types based on the openid value 'init_data' when the request user is authenticated.

**Note**: Developers can use the TypeListModel class to define and manage staff types in the application, customize the metadata settings, and perform filtering and serialization operations related to staff types.
### ClassDef Meta
**Meta**: The function of Meta is to define metadata options for the TypeListModel class.

**attributes**:
- db_table: Specifies the database table name for the TypeListModel class as 'stafftype'.
- verbose_name: Sets a human-readable name for the model as 'Staff Type'.
- verbose_name_plural: Provides a plural name for the model as 'Staff Type'.
- ordering: Defines the default ordering of records based on the 'staff_type' field.

**Code Description**:
The Meta class in the TypeListModel class is used to configure metadata options for the model. In this case, the db_table attribute specifies the database table name as 'stafftype'. The verbose_name attribute sets a readable name for the model as 'Staff Type', while verbose_name_plural provides a plural name for the model. The ordering attribute determines the default ordering of records based on the 'staff_type' field.

**Note**:
Developers can customize the Meta class in the TypeListModel to define various options such as database table name, verbose names, and default ordering for the model. This allows for better organization and customization of the model's metadata.
