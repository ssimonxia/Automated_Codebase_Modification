## ClassDef APIViewSet
**APIViewSet**: The function of APIViewSet is to handle various CRUD operations for the ListModel data, including retrieving, creating, updating, partially updating, and deleting data.

**attributes**:
- pagination_class: MyPageNumberPagination
- filter_backends: DjangoFilterBackend, OrderingFilter
- ordering_fields: 'id', 'create_time', 'update_time'
- filter_class: Filter

**Code Description**:
The `APIViewSet` class extends `viewsets.ModelViewSet` and provides methods to interact with the ListModel data. It includes functions like `list`, `create`, `update`, `partial_update`, `destroy`, `get_project`, `get_queryset`, and `get_serializer_class` to perform corresponding actions on the data.

In the `list` method, the class filters data based on `staff_name` and `check_code` parameters. It checks for the existence of the user, locks the user if necessary conditions are met, and validates the check code before returning the data list.

The `get_project` method retrieves the primary key for the data. The `get_queryset` method filters the queryset based on the user and data status. The `get_serializer_class` method selects the appropriate serializer based on the action performed.

The `create`, `update`, `partial_update`, and `destroy` methods handle data creation, updating, partial updating, and deletion respectively. They include validations to ensure data integrity and ownership before performing the operations.

**Note**:
Developers can utilize the `APIViewSet` class to implement CRUD functionality for the ListModel data with custom validations and permissions.

**Output Example**:
A possible response from the `list` method:
```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "staff_name": "John Doe",
    "staff_type": "Manager",
    "create_time": "2022-01-01T12:00:00",
    "update_time": "2022-01-02T10:30:00"
}
```
### FunctionDef list(self, request)
**list**: The function of list is to handle the retrieval of staff information based on the provided staff name and verification code.

**parameters**:
- request: Represents the request made to the API.
- *args: Additional positional arguments.
- **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments.

**Code Description**:
The function first retrieves the 'staff_name' and 'check_code' from the request parameters. It then checks if both 'staff_name' and 'check_code' are None, in which case it returns the list of staff. If 'staff_name' is provided but 'check_code' is None, it also returns the list of staff. If 'staff_name' is provided, it queries the database to find a staff member with the given name, checks for certain conditions, and handles the verification code. If the verification code is correct, it returns the list of staff.

**Note**: 
- This function is designed to handle staff retrieval based on name and verification code.
- It includes logic to handle cases where the staff name does not exist, the staff is locked, or the verification code is incorrect.

**Output Example**:
A list of staff members matching the provided criteria.

### FunctionDef get_queryset(self)
**get_queryset**: The function of get_queryset is to filter ListModel objects based on the presence of an 'id' value and an authenticated user.

**parameters**:
- self: The reference to the current instance of the class.

**Code Description**:
The get_queryset function first calls the get_project function to retrieve the 'id' value. It then checks if the request has an authenticated user. If an 'id' value is present, it filters ListModel objects by 'openid', 'id', and 'is_delete' status. If no 'id' is found, it filters ListModel objects by 'openid' and 'is_delete' status. If there is no authenticated user, an empty queryset is returned.

The function ensures that the ListModel objects are filtered appropriately based on the conditions mentioned above.

**Note**: Proper exception handling is crucial when using this function to maintain error resilience.

**Output Example**:
If an 'id' value is present and the user is authenticated:
```python
return ListModel.objects.filter(openid=self.request.auth.openid, id=id, is_delete=False)
```
If no 'id' value is found and the user is authenticated:
```python
return ListModel.objects.filter(openid=self.request.auth.openid, is_delete=False)
```
If there is no authenticated user:
```python
return ListModel.objects.none()
```
