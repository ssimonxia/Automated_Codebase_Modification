## ClassDef StaffConfig
**StaffConfig**: The function of StaffConfig is to configure the staff application.

**attributes**:
- name: It specifies the name of the application as 'staff'.

**Code Description**:
The StaffConfig class is a subclass of AppConfig, used for configuring the staff application. The 'name' attribute is set to 'staff' to identify the application. The class contains a 'ready' method that connects the 'do_init_data' function to the 'post_migrate' signal when the application is ready.

**Note**:
Developers can utilize the StaffConfig class to customize and configure the staff application in Django. The 'ready' method allows for executing specific tasks or initializing data when the application is fully loaded.
### FunctionDef ready(self)
**ready**: The function of ready is to connect the do_init_data function to the post_migrate signal with the sender set to self.

**parameters**:
- self: Refers to the instance of the StaffConfig class.

**Code Description**:
The ready function establishes a connection between the do_init_data function and the post_migrate signal. When the post_migrate signal is sent, the do_init_data function is triggered with the sender parameter set to self. This connection ensures that the initialization of default staff types occurs after the migration process, maintaining consistency in the staff types within the application.

The ready function plays a crucial role in automating the initialization process of default staff types, ensuring that the predefined set of staff types is in place for effective staff management.

**Note**:
Developers can rely on the ready function to seamlessly integrate the initialization of default staff types into the application's migration process, simplifying the setup and maintenance of staff-related functionalities.

## FunctionDef do_init_data(sender)
**do_init_data**: The function of do_init_data is to initialize a set of default staff types by calling the init_category function if they do not exist or do not match the expected count.

**parameters**:
- sender: The sender of the signal triggering the function.
- **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments.

**Code Description**:
The do_init_data function is triggered by a signal and calls the init_category function to ensure the existence of a specific set of default staff types. If the count of staff types with the specified openid 'init_data' is not 7, the existing entries are deleted, and a new set of default staff types is created using the bulk_create method. This function helps in maintaining a consistent and predefined set of staff types for the application.

**Note**:
Developers can utilize the do_init_data function to automatically initialize default staff types, ensuring a standardized setup for staff management in the application.
## FunctionDef init_category
**init_category**: The function of init_category is to initialize a set of default staff types if they do not exist or do not match the expected count.

**parameters**:
- None

**Code Description**:
The init_category function first attempts to import the TypeListModel class from the models module. It then checks if there are existing staff types with a specific openid 'init_data'. If the count of such staff types is not 7, the function deletes the existing entries and creates a new set of default staff types. The default staff types include Manager, Supplier, Customer, Supervisor, Inbound, Outbound, and StockControl. These staff types are created with specific attributes such as id, openid, staff_type, and creater using the bulk_create method. If no staff types with the specified openid are found, the function creates the default staff types directly.

The function ensures that the staff types are initialized correctly and consistently, providing a predefined set of staff types for the application.

**Note**:
Developers can utilize the init_category function to set up default staff types in the application, ensuring a consistent initial state for staff management.

**Output Example**:
None
