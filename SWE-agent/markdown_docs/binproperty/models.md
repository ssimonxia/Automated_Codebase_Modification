## ClassDef ListModel
**ListModel**: The function of ListModel is to define a model for storing bin properties with specific attributes.

**attributes**: 
- bin_property: A CharField to store the bin property with a maximum length of 32 characters.
- creater: A CharField to store the creator's name with a maximum length of 255 characters.
- openid: A CharField to store the openid with a maximum length of 255 characters.
- is_delete: A BooleanField to indicate if the entry is marked for deletion, default is set to False.
- create_time: A DateTimeField that automatically stores the creation time of the entry.
- update_time: A DateTimeField that automatically stores the last update time of the entry, can be blank and nullable.

**Code Description**: 
The ListModel class is a Django model that represents a table in the database for storing bin properties. It contains fields such as bin_property, creater, openid, is_delete, create_time, and update_time to store relevant information about each bin property entry. The Meta class within ListModel specifies the database table name, verbose names for better readability in the Django admin interface, and the default ordering based on the bin_property field.

**Note**: 
Developers can use this ListModel class to create, retrieve, update, and delete bin property entries in the database. When working with instances of ListModel, they can access and manipulate the attributes defined in the class to manage bin properties effectively.
### ClassDef Meta
**Meta**: The function of Meta is to define metadata options for the ListModel class.

**attributes**:
- db_table: Specifies the database table name for the ListModel class as 'binproperty'.
- verbose_name: Sets a human-readable name for the ListModel class as 'Bin Property'.
- verbose_name_plural: Provides a plural name for the ListModel class as 'Bin Property'.
- ordering: Defines the default ordering of query results based on the 'bin_property' field.

**Code Description**:
The Meta class in the ListModel class is used to configure metadata options for the ListModel class. The 'db_table' attribute specifies the name of the database table to be used for storing instances of the ListModel class. The 'verbose_name' attribute sets a human-readable name for the ListModel class, while 'verbose_name_plural' provides a plural name for the class. The 'ordering' attribute determines the default ordering of query results when retrieving instances of the ListModel class from the database. In this case, the ordering is based on the 'bin_property' field.

**Note**:
Developers can customize the behavior of the ListModel class by modifying the attributes of the Meta class according to their specific requirements. The Meta class plays a crucial role in defining how the ListModel class interacts with the database and how it is displayed in the user interface.
