## ClassDef BinpropertyConfig
**BinpropertyConfig**: The function of BinpropertyConfig is to configure the 'binproperty' app.

**attributes**:
- name: Represents the name of the app which is set to 'binproperty'.

**Code Description**:
The BinpropertyConfig class is a configuration class that inherits from AppConfig. It is used to configure the 'binproperty' app within a Django project. The 'name' attribute is set to 'binproperty', indicating the name of the app. Additionally, the class contains a 'ready' method that connects the 'do_init_data' function to the post_migrate signal when the app is ready.

**Note**:
Developers can utilize the BinpropertyConfig class to define configurations specific to the 'binproperty' Django app. The 'ready' method allows for executing custom initialization logic when the app is fully loaded and ready to use.
### FunctionDef ready(self)
**ready**: The function of ready is to connect the do_init_data function to the post_migrate signal with the sender set to self.

**parameters**:
- self: Represents the instance of the class calling the ready function.

**Code Description**:
The ready function establishes a connection between the do_init_data function and the post_migrate signal. When the ready function is called, it triggers the execution of the do_init_data function with the sender parameter set to self. This connection ensures that after the migration of models is completed, the initialization of a category in the ListModel is initiated.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the necessary imports and configurations are in place for the proper execution of the ready function.
- Handle any exceptions that may arise during the execution of the ready function.

## FunctionDef do_init_data(sender)
**do_init_data**: The function of do_init_data is to initialize a category in the ListModel if it does not already exist.

**parameters**:
- sender: Represents the sender of the signal triggering the function.
- **kwargs: Represents additional keyword arguments passed to the function.

**Code Description**:
The do_init_data function is responsible for triggering the initialization of a category in the ListModel by calling the init_category function. When invoked, it first imports the ListModel from the models module. Subsequently, it checks if a specific entry with openid='init_data' exists in the ListModel. If the entry exists but the count is not equal to 4, the existing entries with openid='init_data' are deleted, and a new set of entries for different bin properties is created and bulk inserted into the ListModel. If the entry does not exist, a new set of entries for different bin properties is created and bulk inserted into the ListModel.

The function ensures that there are only four specific entries with openid='init_data' in the ListModel, each representing a different bin property.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the ListModel is correctly defined and imported for the proper execution of this function.
- Handle any exceptions that may occur during the execution of this function.

This function is called during the post-migrate phase of the application's readiness by the BinpropertyConfig class in the ready method, ensuring that the category initialization process is triggered after the migration of the models has been completed.
## FunctionDef init_category
**init_category**: The function of init_category is to initialize a category in the ListModel if it does not already exist.

**parameters**:
- None

**Code Description**:
The init_category function first attempts to import the ListModel from the models module. It then checks if a specific entry with openid='init_data' exists in the ListModel. If the entry exists but the count is not equal to 4, the existing entries with openid='init_data' are deleted, and a new set of entries for different bin properties is created and bulk inserted into the ListModel. If the entry does not exist, a new set of entries for different bin properties is created and bulk inserted into the ListModel.

The function ensures that there are only four specific entries with openid='init_data' in the ListModel, each representing a different bin property.

**Note**:
- This function relies on the ListModel from the models module, so ensure that the ListModel is correctly defined and imported.
- Make sure to handle any exceptions that may occur during the execution of this function.

**Output Example**:
None
