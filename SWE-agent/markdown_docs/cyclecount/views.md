## ClassDef GetGoodsCyclecountViewSet
**GetGoodsCyclecountViewSet**: The GetGoodsCyclecountViewSet class is a viewset that handles the retrieval and creation of manual cycle count data for goods in stock bins.

**Attributes**:
- pagination_class: The pagination class used for paginating the list of manual cycle count data.
- filter_backends: The list of filter backends used for filtering the manual cycle count data.
- ordering_fields: The list of fields that can be used for ordering the manual cycle count data.
- filter_class: The filter class used for filtering the manual cycle count data.

**Code Description**:
The GetGoodsCyclecountViewSet class extends the StockBinViewSet class and provides the functionality to retrieve and create manual cycle count data for goods in stock bins.

The list() method is responsible for retrieving the manual cycle count data. It first retrieves the staff name of the authenticated user from the staff model. Then, it filters the queryset based on the requested goods code. For each stock bin in the queryset, it checks if there is an existing manual cycle count data with the same bin name and goods code. If such data exists, it is deleted. Then, a new manual cycle count data is created with the necessary information such as the openid, staff name, bin name, goods code, goods quantity, and other fields. The data is validated using the ManualCyclecountPostSerializer serializer and saved to the database. Finally, the retrieved manual cycle count data is paginated and serialized using the ManualCyclecountGetSerializer serializer before being returned as a response.

**Note**:
- The GetGoodsCyclecountViewSet class extends the StockBinViewSet class.
- The list() method retrieves and creates manual cycle count data for goods in stock bins.
- The staff name is retrieved from the staff model based on the authenticated user.
- Existing manual cycle count data with the same bin name and goods code is deleted before creating a new one.
