## ClassDef DnListFilter
An unknown error occurred while generating this documentation after many tries.
### ClassDef Meta
**Meta**: The function of Meta is to define metadata options for the DnListFilter class.

**attributes**:
- model: DnListModel
- fields: A dictionary containing field names as keys and a list of lookup types as values.

**Code Description**:
The Meta class within the DnListFilter class defines metadata options for the filter. It specifies the model attribute as DnListModel and the fields attribute as a dictionary containing various field names along with the corresponding lookup types. This configuration allows the DnListFilter class to filter query results based on the specified fields and lookup types.

The Meta class plays a crucial role in customizing the behavior of the DnListFilter class by providing information about the model to be filtered and the specific fields to apply filters on. By defining these options within the Meta class, developers can easily control how filtering operations are performed within the DnListFilter class.

**Note**:
Developers can customize the Meta class further by adding additional options such as ordering, permissions, or verbose names to enhance the functionality of the DnListFilter class.

## ClassDef DnDetailFilter
**DnDetailFilter**: The function of DnDetailFilter is to provide a filtering mechanism for the DnDetailModel objects based on specified fields and their corresponding lookup types.

**Attributes**:
- model: The model class to which the filter is applied (DnDetailModel).
- fields: A dictionary specifying the fields of the model and their allowed lookup types.

**Code Description**:
The `DnDetailFilter` class is a subclass of `FilterSet` and provides a filtering mechanism for the `DnDetailModel` objects. It allows developers to filter the objects based on specific fields and their corresponding lookup types.

The `model` attribute is set to the `DnDetailModel` class, indicating that the filter is applied to this model.

The `fields` attribute is a dictionary that specifies the fields of the model and their allowed lookup types. Each field is a key in the dictionary, and its value is a list of allowed lookup types. These lookup types define how the field can be filtered, such as exact match, case-insensitive match, greater than, less than, etc.

Developers can use this filter class to create custom filters for the `DnDetailModel` objects by specifying the desired fields and lookup types in the `fields` attribute.

This filter class can be used in conjunction with other components, such as viewsets or views, to provide filtering functionality for the `DnDetailModel` objects in the project.

In the project, the `DnDetailFilter` class is called by the following objects:
- `dashboard/views.py/SalesViewSet`: The `DnDetailFilter` is used as the `filter_class` attribute in the `SalesViewSet` class, which is a viewset for handling sales data. This allows the sales data to be filtered based on the specified fields and lookup types defined in the `DnDetailFilter`.
- `dn/views.py/DnDetailViewSet`: The `DnDetailFilter` is used as the `filter_class` attribute in the `DnDetailViewSet` class, which is a viewset for handling DN (Delivery Note) detail data. This allows the DN detail data to be filtered based on the specified fields and lookup types defined in the `DnDetailFilter`.
- `dn/views.py/FileDetailDownloadView`: The `DnDetailFilter` is used as the `filter_class` attribute in the `FileDetailDownloadView` class, which is a viewset for downloading file details. This allows the file details to be filtered based on the specified fields and lookup types defined in the `DnDetailFilter`.
- `scanner/views.py/SannerDnDetailPickingListView`: The `DnDetailFilter` is used as the `filter_class` attribute in the `SannerDnDetailPickingListView` class, which is a viewset for listing DN detail data for picking. This allows the DN detail data to be filtered based on the specified fields and lookup types defined in the `DnDetailFilter`.

**Note**: When using the `DnDetailFilter` class, developers should refer to the `fields` attribute to determine the available fields and their corresponding lookup types for filtering the `DnDetailModel` objects.
### ClassDef Meta
**Meta**: The function of Meta is to define the metadata options for the DnDetailFilter class.

**attributes**: 
- model: Represents the DnDetailModel class.
- fields: Contains a dictionary with field names as keys and a list of lookup types as values.

**Code Description**: 
The Meta class within the DnDetailFilter class defines metadata options. It specifies the model attribute as DnDetailModel, which is a model representing detailed information about a delivery note. The fields attribute is a dictionary that maps field names to a list of lookup types that can be used for filtering data related to the DnDetailModel. This configuration allows for precise filtering and querying of data based on specific criteria.

The Meta class plays a crucial role in configuring how the DnDetailFilter class interacts with the DnDetailModel. By defining the model attribute, it establishes the connection to the appropriate model, and by specifying the fields attribute, it customizes the filtering options available for the DnDetailFilter class.

**Note**: 
Developers can leverage the Meta class to fine-tune the behavior of the DnDetailFilter class by adjusting the model and fields attributes according to their filtering requirements. This customization enhances the flexibility and efficiency of data retrieval operations within the context of the DnDetailFilter class.

## ClassDef DnPickingListFilter
**DnPickingListFilter**: The function of DnPickingListFilter is to define filter options for the PickingListModel based on specific fields.

**attributes**: 
- model: PickingListModel
- fields: Dictionary containing field names as keys and a list of filter options as values

**Code Description**: 
The DnPickingListFilter class is a part of the Django Filter package and is used to specify filtering options for the PickingListModel. It defines various fields such as 'id', 'dn_code', 'bin_name', 'goods_code', 'picking_status', 'pick_qty', 'picked_qty', 'creater', 'create_time', and 'update_time', each with a list of filter options that can be applied to them. These filter options include 'exact', 'iexact', 'contains', 'icontains', 'gt', 'gte', 'lt', 'lte', 'isnull', 'in', 'range', 'year', 'month', 'day', 'week_day'. 

In the project, the DnPickingListFilter class is utilized in the DnPickingListFilterViewSet class defined in dn/views.py. The DnPickingListFilterViewSet class extends viewsets.ModelViewSet and specifies the filter backend, ordering fields, and filter class to be used for the PickingListModel. It also includes methods to customize the queryset based on the request user and to determine the serializer class based on the action performed.

**Note**: 
Developers can utilize the DnPickingListFilter class to create custom filters for the PickingListModel based on specific fields and filter options. The class provides flexibility in defining how data should be filtered when querying the PickingListModel.
### ClassDef Meta
**Meta**: The function of Meta is to define metadata for the PickingListModel class, such as the database table name, verbose names, and default ordering of records.

**Attributes**:
- model: PickingListModel
- fields: A dictionary containing field names as keys and a list of lookup types as values.

**Code Description**:
The Meta class within the PickingListModel class serves as a container for metadata definitions. It specifies the model to which the metadata applies (PickingListModel in this case) and defines the fields attribute as a dictionary. The fields dictionary contains field names as keys and a list of lookup types as values. This configuration allows for specifying the available lookup types for each field when performing queries or filtering operations on PickingListModel instances.

In this context, the Meta class provides a structured way to organize and manage metadata related to the PickingListModel class, enhancing the flexibility and customization options when working with instances of the model.

**Note**:
Developers can leverage the Meta class to customize the behavior of the PickingListModel class, such as specifying the database table name, verbose names for the model, and defining the default ordering of records. This customization helps in maintaining a well-organized and efficient data model structure within the project.
