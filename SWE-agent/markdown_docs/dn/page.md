## ClassDef MyPageNumberPaginationDNList
**MyPageNumberPaginationDNList**: The function of MyPageNumberPaginationDNList is to customize pagination behavior for a list of objects by providing methods to retrieve previous and next page links, as well as constructing a paginated response with specific data.

**attributes**:
- page_size: The number of items to include on a page.
- page_size_query_param: The query parameter to control the page size.
- max_page_size: The maximum number of items allowed on a page.
- page_query_param: The query parameter to control the current page.

**Code Description**:
The `MyPageNumberPaginationDNList` class extends `PageNumberPagination` and overrides three main methods:
1. `get_previous_link`: Constructs the link to the previous page based on the current page's information.
2. `get_next_link`: Constructs the link to the next page based on the current page's information.
3. `get_paginated_response`: Generates a paginated response containing a list of customers, the total count of items, links to the next and previous pages, and the actual data to be displayed.

In the `get_previous_link` and `get_next_link` methods, the class checks for the existence of previous and next pages, constructs the URL with necessary modifications, and handles exceptions for incorrect API URLs.

The `get_paginated_response` method fetches customer data based on the authenticated user, prepares a list of customer names, and constructs a response containing the customer list, total count, next and previous page links, and the actual data passed as an argument.

This class is utilized in the `DnListViewSet` class within the `dn/views.py` file to handle pagination for a list of objects in the context of a Django REST framework viewset. The `pagination_class` attribute of the `DnListViewSet` is set to `MyPageNumberPaginationDNList`, enabling the customized pagination behavior defined in the `MyPageNumberPaginationDNList` class.

**Note**: Ensure that the `remove_query_param`, `replace_query_param`, `APIException`, `customer`, and `Response` classes or functions are defined and imported correctly for the methods in the `MyPageNumberPaginationDNList` class to work as expected.

**Output Example**:
```json
{
    "customer_list": ["Customer A", "Customer B", "Customer C"],
    "count": 100,
    "next": "https://api.example.com/customers?page=3",
    "previous": "https://api.example.com/customers?page=1",
    "results": [{}, {}, {}]
}
```
### FunctionDef get_previous_link(self)
**get_previous_link**: The function of get_previous_link is to generate the previous page link based on the current page number.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.
  
**Code Description**:
The get_previous_link function first checks if there is a previous page available. If there is, it constructs the previous page link by manipulating the URL based on the current page number. It extracts the URL components, checks the URL format, and then modifies the URL to include the previous page number. If the page number is 1, it removes the page query parameter. Finally, if the URL format is incorrect, it raises an APIException with a message indicating a wrong API URL.

This function is part of the MyPageNumberPaginationDNList class and is used to provide the previous page link in paginated responses.

In the calling object get_paginated_response, the get_previous_link function is used to include the previous page link in the paginated response along with other data such as the customer list, count, and next page link.

**Note**:
- This function assumes a specific URL format and may not work correctly with URLs in different formats.
- The function relies on the availability of certain attributes and methods from the class instance.

**Output Example**:
```python
{
    'customer_list': ['Customer1', 'Customer2', 'Customer3'],
    'count': 100,
    'next': 'http://api.example.com/customers?page=3',
    'previous': 'http://api.example.com/customers?page=1',
    'results': [result1, result2, result3]
}
```

### FunctionDef get_next_link(self)
**get_next_link**: The function of get_next_link is to generate the URL for the next page in a paginated response.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.
  
**Code Description**: 
The get_next_link function first checks if there is a next page available. If there is, it constructs the URL for the next page by appending the next page number as a query parameter. It also ensures the URL is correctly formatted based on the number of colons in the original URL. If the URL format is incorrect, it raises an APIException with a message indicating a wrong API URL.

In the calling object get_paginated_response, the get_next_link function is used to retrieve the URL for the next page in the paginated response. This URL is included in the response along with other data such as the list of customers, count of items, and the URL for the previous page.

**Note**: 
- This function relies on the availability of certain attributes and methods from the class instance, such as self.page, self.request, self.page_query_param, and the replace_query_param function.
- It is important to ensure that the URL format is correct to avoid any issues with constructing the next page URL.

**Output Example**: 
"http://example.com/api/customers?page=2"

### FunctionDef get_paginated_response(self, data)
**get_paginated_response**: The function of get_paginated_response is to generate a paginated response containing a list of customers, count of items, next page link, previous page link, and the provided data.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.
- data: The data to be included in the paginated response.

**Code Description**:
The get_paginated_response function retrieves a list of customers based on the authenticated user's openid, constructs a customer_list from the retrieved data, and then creates a paginated response. The response includes the customer_list, count of items, next page link obtained from the get_next_link function, previous page link obtained from the get_previous_link function, and the provided data. This function is an essential part of the pagination process in the MyPageNumberPaginationDNList class, ensuring that the paginated response contains all necessary information for navigation and data display.

In the context of the project, the get_paginated_response function utilizes the get_next_link and get_previous_link functions to include the next and previous page links in the paginated response. By combining these elements, the function facilitates the navigation between pages of data and enhances the user experience when interacting with paginated results.

**Note**:
- The function relies on the availability of specific attributes and methods from the class instance, such as self.request, self.page.paginator.count, self.get_next_link(), and self.get_previous_link().
- It is crucial to ensure that the provided data is structured correctly to be included in the paginated response.
- The function assumes a specific structure for the customer data retrieval and may need adjustments for different data sources or formats.

**Output Example**:
```python
{
    'customer_list': ['Customer1', 'Customer2', 'Customer3'],
    'count': 100,
    'next': 'http://api.example.com/customers?page=3',
    'previous': 'http://api.example.com/customers?page=1',
    'results': [result1, result2, result3]
}
```
