- model: Specifies the model class DnListModel that the serializer should be based on.
- ref_name: Provides a reference name 'DNFileListRenderSerializer' for the serializer.
- exclude: Specifies a list of fields ('openid', 'is_delete') to be excluded from serialization.

**Code Description**:
The Meta class within the FileListRenderSerializer class is used to define metadata options for the serializer. It specifies the model attribute as DnListModel, indicating the model class that the serializer should be based on. The ref_name attribute assigns a reference name 'DNFileListRenderSerializer' to the serializer for identification purposes. Additionally, the exclude attribute is used to specify a list of fields ('openid', 'is_delete') that should be excluded from the serialization process. This allows customization of how the serializer interacts with the model data.

**Note**:
Developers can utilize the Meta class to configure various options for the serializer, such as the model to be used, reference names, and fields to exclude during serialization. This provides flexibility in customizing the behavior of the serializer based on specific requirements.

## ClassDef FileDetailRenderSerializer
**FileDetailRenderSerializer**: The function of FileDetailRenderSerializer is to serialize the data of a file detail render, including various fields such as codes, quantities, timestamps, and boolean values.

**attributes**:
- dn_code: CharField
- dn_status: IntegerField
- customer: CharField
- goods_code: CharField
- goods_desc: CharField
- goods_qty: IntegerField
- pick_qty: IntegerField
- picked_qty: IntegerField
- intransit_qty: IntegerField
- delivery_actual_qty: IntegerField
- delivery_shortage_qty: IntegerField
- delivery_more_qty: IntegerField
- delivery_damage_qty: IntegerField
- goods_weight: FloatField
- goods_volume: FloatField
- goods_cost: FloatField
- creater: CharField
- create_time: DateTimeField
- update_time: DateTimeField
- back_order_label: BooleanField

**Code Description**:
The FileDetailRenderSerializer class is a ModelSerializer that defines the serialization behavior for file detail render data. It includes various fields such as codes, quantities, timestamps, and boolean values related to file details. The class Meta inside the serializer specifies the model to be used and excludes certain fields like 'openid' and 'is_delete' from serialization.

This serializer is utilized in the dn/views.py file within the FileDetailDownloadView class. In the get_serializer_class method, the FileDetailRenderSerializer is returned based on the action type. If the action is 'list', the serializer is returned to handle the serialization of data. In the list method of the same class, instances of the queryset are serialized using the FileDetailRenderSerializer, and the data is then rendered in a CSV format for download. The file name for download is generated based on the current date and time.

**Note**:
Developers can use this serializer to serialize file detail render data and customize the serialization behavior by modifying the attributes and Meta options as needed.
### ClassDef Meta
**Meta**: The function of Meta is to define metadata options for the FileDetailRenderSerializer class.

**attributes**:
- model: Specifies the model to use for the serializer.
- ref_name: Sets a reference name for the serializer.
- exclude: Defines a list of fields to be excluded from serialization.

**Code Description**:
The Meta class within the FileDetailRenderSerializer class is used to provide metadata options for the serializer. In this specific implementation, the Meta class includes three attributes:
1. **model**: It is set to DnDetailModel, which indicates the model that the serializer should use for serialization.
2. **ref_name**: The ref_name attribute is assigned the value 'DNFileDetailRenderSerializer', serving as a reference name for the serializer.
3. **exclude**: This attribute is a list containing field names like 'openid' and 'is_delete', specifying the fields that should be excluded from the serialization process.

The Meta class plays a crucial role in configuring how the serializer interacts with the model and which fields are included or excluded during serialization. By defining these metadata options, developers can customize the behavior of the serializer to suit the requirements of the application.

**Note**:
Developers can further customize the serializer behavior by adding more options to the Meta class, such as ordering, additional fields, or any other specific requirements for serialization.
