## ClassDef FreightGetSerializer
**FreightGetSerializer**: The function of FreightGetSerializer is to serialize data related to transportation fees with specific fields and configurations.

**attributes**:
- send_city: CharField (read-only, not required)
- receiver_city: CharField (read-only, not required)
- weight_fee: FloatField (read-only, not required)
- volume_fee: FloatField (read-only, not required)
- transportation_supplier: CharField (read-only, not required)
- creater: CharField (read-only, not required)
- create_time: DateTimeField (read-only, format='%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
- update_time: DateTimeField (read-only, format='%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')

**Code Description**:
The FreightGetSerializer class is a subclass of the ModelSerializer class provided by Django REST framework. It is designed to serialize instances of the TransportationFeeListModel model. The class defines various fields such as send_city, receiver_city, weight_fee, volume_fee, transportation_supplier, creater, create_time, and update_time. These fields are configured as read-only and not required for input.

The Meta inner class specifies the model to be serialized as TransportationFeeListModel. It also excludes certain fields like 'openid', 'is_delete' from the serialization process and sets the 'id' field as read-only.

In the project, this serializer is utilized in the TransportationFeeListViewSet to handle different actions based on the request type. When the action is 'list', 'retrieve', or 'destroy', the FreightGetSerializer is returned to serialize data. For other actions like 'create', 'update', and 'partial_update', different serializers are used based on the specific requirements.

**Note**:
Developers can use FreightGetSerializer to serialize transportation fee data in a specific format suitable for API responses. Ensure to understand the read-only nature and field configurations set in the serializer class to avoid any unexpected behavior during serialization.
