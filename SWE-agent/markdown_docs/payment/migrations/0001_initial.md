## ClassDef Migration
**Migration**: The function of Migration is to define a migration operation for creating a model in the database.

**attributes**:
· initial: A boolean attribute indicating if this migration is the initial one.
· dependencies: A list of dependencies for the migration.
· operations: A list of database operations to be applied during the migration.

**Code Description**:
The Migration class inherits from migrations.Migration and contains attributes to define the migration process. The 'initial' attribute is set to True by default, indicating that this is the initial migration. The 'dependencies' attribute is an empty list, meaning there are no dependencies for this migration. The 'operations' attribute contains a list of database operations to be executed, in this case, creating a model named 'TransportationFeeListModel' with various fields such as 'send_city', 'receiver_city', 'weight_fee', 'volume_fee', 'min_payment', 'transportation_supplier', 'creater', 'openid', 'is_delete', 'create_time', and 'update_time'. These fields define the structure of the 'TransportationFeeListModel' model along with their data types and additional properties like verbose names and default values. The 'options' dictionary provides metadata for the model such as verbose names, table name, ordering, etc.

**Note**:
Developers can customize the migration by adding dependencies and different database operations based on their specific requirements.
