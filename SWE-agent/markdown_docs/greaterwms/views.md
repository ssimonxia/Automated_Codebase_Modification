## FunctionDef robots(request)
**robots**: The function of robots is to serve a file as a streaming response based on the request path.

**parameters**:
- request: Represents the HTTP request made by the client.

**Code Description**:
The "robots" function first constructs the file path by appending the request path to the base directory. It then uses the Python mimetypes module to guess the content type and encoding of the file. Next, it creates a StreamingHttpResponse object by streaming the file content using FileWrapper and sets the content type. Finally, it sets the Cache-Control header to specify a long cache duration and returns the response.

This function is typically used to serve files to clients in a streaming manner, ensuring efficient handling of large files without loading them entirely into memory.

**Note**:
Developers should ensure that the requested file exists to prevent errors.
Proper permission handling should be implemented to restrict access to sensitive files.

**Output Example**:
A streaming response containing the requested file with the specified content type and cache control settings.
## FunctionDef favicon(request)
**favicon**: The function of favicon is to serve the favicon image of the website.

**parameters**:
- request: The HTTP request object.

**Code Description**: The favicon function retrieves the path to the favicon image file, determines the content type and encoding of the file, creates a StreamingHttpResponse object to stream the file, sets the Cache-Control header to specify caching behavior, and finally returns the StreamingHttpResponse object.

This function first constructs the path to the favicon image file using the BASE_DIR setting and a static path. It then uses the mimetypes module to guess the content type and encoding of the file based on the file extension. Next, it creates a StreamingHttpResponse object by wrapping the file in a FileWrapper and setting the content type. The Cache-Control header is then set to indicate a long caching duration. Finally, the function returns the StreamingHttpResponse object containing the favicon image.

**Note**: Make sure the path to the favicon image file is correct and accessible. Adjust the caching duration in the Cache-Control header based on your specific requirements.

**Output Example**: 
A StreamingHttpResponse object streaming the favicon image with the appropriate content type and caching settings.
## FunctionDef css(request)
**css**: The function of css is to serve CSS files based on the requested path.

**parameters**:
- request: Represents the HTTP request made by the client.

**Code Description**:
The `css` function first constructs the full path of the requested CSS file by appending the request path to the base directory path. It then uses the `mimetypes.guess_type` function to determine the content type and encoding of the file. Next, it creates a `StreamingHttpResponse` object with the file content wrapped in a `FileWrapper` and sets the content type. The function then sets the 'Cache-Control' header to specify a long cache duration before returning the response.

This function is typically used to dynamically serve CSS files to clients based on the requested path within the 'templates/dist/spa' directory.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the requested CSS files are located within the 'templates/dist/spa' directory to be served correctly.
- Be cautious about serving sensitive files or directories using this function to prevent security risks.

**Output Example**:
A StreamingHttpResponse object containing the requested CSS file with the appropriate content type and cache control settings.
## FunctionDef js(request)
**js**: The function of js is to serve static files from the specified path.

**parameters**:
- request: Represents the HTTP request.
  
**Code Description**:
The `js` function constructs a file path based on the request path info and serves the file as a streaming response. It determines the content type and encoding of the file using the `mimetypes.guess_type` function. The response object is then configured with the file content and content type before setting the cache control header to a maximum age of 864000000000 seconds. Finally, the function returns the response object.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the path to the static files is correctly configured in the `BASE_DIR` and `templates/dist/spa` directories.
- Make sure that the appropriate permissions are set to access the files being served.

**Output Example**:
A StreamingHttpResponse object serving the static file with the specified content type and cache control header set.
## FunctionDef statics(request)
**statics**: The function of statics is to serve static files based on the request path.

**parameters**:
- request: Represents the HTTP request made by the client.

**Code Description**:
The statics function first constructs the path to the requested static file by appending the request path to the base directory path. It then uses the mimetypes module to guess the content type and encoding of the file. Next, it creates a StreamingHttpResponse object by streaming the file content using FileWrapper and setting the content type. The function sets the 'Cache-Control' header to ensure caching of the static files and finally returns the response.

This function is called within the views.py file in the statics directory of the greaterwms application.

**Note**: Ensure that the settings.BASE_DIR is correctly configured to point to the base directory of the project where static files are stored. Additionally, make sure that the path to the static files is accurate and accessible.

**Output Example**:
A StreamingHttpResponse object containing the content of the requested static file with the appropriate content type and caching settings.
## FunctionDef fonts(request)
**fonts**: The function of fonts is to serve font files based on the request path.

**parameters**: 
- request: Represents the HTTP request made by the client.

**Code Description**: 
The `fonts` function constructs a file path based on the request path provided, guesses the content type and encoding of the file, creates a StreamingHttpResponse object to stream the file content, sets the Cache-Control header to a very long max-age value, and finally returns the response object.

This function is called within the views.py file in the fonts directory of the greaterwms application. It is used to dynamically serve font files to clients based on the requested path.

**Note**: 
Developers should ensure that the font files are stored in the correct directory structure for this function to work properly. Additionally, the long max-age value set for the Cache-Control header may impact caching behavior and should be adjusted based on specific requirements.

**Output Example**: 
A StreamingHttpResponse object containing the content of the requested font file with the appropriate content type and encoding.
## FunctionDef myip(request)
**myip**: The function of myip is to retrieve the IP address of the server where the code is running.

**parameters**:
- request: The HTTP request object.

**Code Description**:
The `myip` function first creates a socket connection using the `socket` module to connect to the Google DNS server at IP address '8.8.8.8' on port 80. It then retrieves the local IP address of the server by calling `getsockname()` on the socket object. The IP address is stored in the variable `ip`, and the socket connection is closed. Finally, the function returns a JSON response containing the server's IP address.

This function is typically used in web applications to retrieve the server's IP address for various purposes like logging, debugging, or displaying to users.

**Note**:
- This function requires the `socket` module to be imported.
- Ensure that the server has network connectivity to the specified IP address and port.

**Output Example**:
```json
{"ip": "192.168.1.1"}
```
