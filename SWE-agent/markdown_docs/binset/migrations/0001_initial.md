## ClassDef Migration
**Migration**: The function of Migration is to define a migration operation for creating a database model.

**attributes**: 
- initial: A boolean attribute indicating if this migration is the initial one.
- dependencies: A list of dependencies for this migration.
- operations: A list of migration operations to be performed.

**Code Description**: 
The Migration class inherits from migrations.Migration and defines the creation of a database model named ListModel. The ListModel consists of various fields such as id, bin_name, bin_size, bin_property, empty_label, creater, bar_code, openid, is_delete, create_time, and update_time. These fields are defined using models.CharField, models.BooleanField, and models.DateTimeField with specific attributes like max_length, default values, and verbose names. The model also includes options like verbose_name, verbose_name_plural, db_table, and ordering. The migration operation specified in the operations attribute is to create the ListModel with the defined fields and options.

**Note**: 
Developers can customize the fields and options of the ListModel as needed by modifying the attributes within the Migration class. It is important to understand the database schema and the purpose of each field before making any changes to the migration operation.
