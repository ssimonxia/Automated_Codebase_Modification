## ClassDef ListModel
**ListModel**: The function of ListModel is to define a model representing a bin set with various attributes such as bin name, size, property, creator, barcode, etc.

**attributes**: 
- bin_name: A character field representing the name of the bin.
- bin_size: A character field representing the size of the bin.
- bin_property: A character field representing the property of the bin.
- empty_label: A boolean field indicating if the bin has an empty label.
- creater: A character field representing the creator of the bin.
- bar_code: A character field representing the barcode of the bin.
- openid: A character field representing the Openid associated with the bin.
- is_delete: A boolean field indicating if the bin is marked for deletion.
- create_time: A DateTime field representing the creation time of the bin.
- update_time: A DateTime field representing the last update time of the bin.

**Code Description**: 
The ListModel class is a Django model that defines the structure of a bin set. It includes various fields such as bin_name, bin_size, bin_property, empty_label, creater, bar_code, openid, is_delete, create_time, and update_time. These fields provide detailed information about each bin in the set. Additionally, the class Meta inside the ListModel specifies metadata such as the database table name, verbose names, ordering, etc.

**Note**: 
Developers can use the ListModel class to create instances of bins in the system. The class provides a structured way to store and manage information related to bins, including their names, sizes, properties, creators, barcodes, and other relevant details. When working with ListModel instances, developers can access and manipulate the attributes defined in the class to interact with bin data effectively.
### ClassDef Meta
**Meta**: The function of Meta is to define metadata options for the ListModel class.

**attributes**:
- db_table: Specifies the database table name for the ListModel class.
- verbose_name: Provides a human-readable name for a single object of the ListModel class.
- verbose_name_plural: Provides a human-readable name for the ListModel class in plural form.
- ordering: Specifies the default ordering of objects returned by queries on the ListModel class.

**Code Description**:
The Meta class within the ListModel class is used to define metadata options for the ListModel class. In this specific implementation:
- The db_table attribute is set to 'binset', indicating the database table name for the ListModel class.
- The verbose_name attribute is set to 'Bin Set', providing a human-readable name for a single object of the ListModel class.
- The verbose_name_plural attribute is set to "Bin Set", providing a human-readable name for the ListModel class in plural form.
- The ordering attribute is set to ['bin_name'], specifying that the default ordering of objects returned by queries on the ListModel class should be based on the 'bin_name' field.

**Note**:
Developers can customize the behavior of the ListModel class by modifying the attributes within the Meta class according to their specific requirements.
