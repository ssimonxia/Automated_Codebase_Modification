- pagination_class: MyPageNumberPagination
- filter_backends: DjangoFilterBackend, OrderingFilter
- ordering_fields: ['id', "create_time", "update_time"]
- filter_class: Filter
- lookup_field: 'bar_code'

**Code Description**:
The `ScannerBinsetTagView` class extends `viewsets.ModelViewSet` and includes methods to retrieve data based on the provided barcode. It utilizes a custom pagination behavior defined in the `MyPageNumberPagination` class for paginated responses. The class specifies filter backends, ordering fields, a filter class, and a lookup field to manage data retrieval and filtering.

The `get_project` method retrieves the barcode from the request parameters. The `get_queryset` method filters the data based on the barcode and user authentication, returning the appropriate data list. The `get_serializer_class` method determines the serializer class based on the action type.

In the context of the project, the `ScannerBinsetTagView` class is used to handle GET requests for retrieving data lists based on barcode parameters. It interacts with the `MyPageNumberPagination` class for pagination, the `Filter` class for data filtering, and other components to provide a structured response to the client.

**Note**:
Developers using the `ScannerBinsetTagView` class should ensure proper handling of authentication, barcode parameters, and data filtering logic. Customization of filter options and pagination behavior can be done by modifying the associated classes and attributes.

**Output Example**:
```json
{
    "bin_size_list": ["small", "medium", "large"],
    "bin_property_list": ["property1", "property2", "property3"],
    "count": 100,
    "next": "http://example.com/api/resource?page=3",
    "previous": "http://example.com/api/resource?page=1",
    "results": [...]
}
```
### FunctionDef get_project(self)
**get_project**: The function of get_project is to retrieve the 'bar_code' value from the 'kwargs' attribute of the object. If the 'bar_code' is not found, it returns None.

**parameters**: 
- No parameters are passed explicitly, as the function accesses the 'kwargs' attribute of the object.

**Code Description**: 
The get_project function attempts to retrieve the 'bar_code' value from the 'kwargs' attribute of the object. If the 'bar_code' is found, it is returned. If an exception occurs during the retrieval process, the function returns None.

In the calling object 'get_queryset', the get_project function is invoked to obtain the 'bar_code' value. Depending on the presence of the 'bar_code' and the user authentication status, different queries are executed on the ListModel objects to filter the results accordingly.

**Note**: 
- It is important to ensure that the 'bar_code' is correctly set in the 'kwargs' attribute before calling this function to avoid potential exceptions.
- Handle the returned value of None appropriately in the calling code to prevent unexpected behavior.

## ClassDef APIViewSet
**APIViewSet**: The APIViewSet class is responsible for handling various API operations related to the ListModel. It extends the ModelViewSet class from the viewsets module in Django REST framework to provide CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) functionality for the ListModel instances.

**attributes**:
- pagination_class: An attribute that specifies the pagination behavior for the APIViewSet. It is set to MyPageNumberPagination, a custom pagination class.
- filter_backends: An attribute that defines the filter backends to be used for filtering the ListModel instances. It is set to [DjangoFilterBackend, OrderingFilter].
- ordering_fields: An attribute that specifies the fields on which the ListModel instances can be ordered. It is set to ['id', "create_time", "update_time"].
- filter_class: An attribute that specifies the filter class to be used for filtering the ListModel instances. It is set to Filter, a custom filter class.

**Code Description**:
The APIViewSet class defines various methods to handle different API operations for the ListModel instances. These methods include retrieve, list, create, delete, partial_update, and update.

- retrieve: This method handles the GET request to retrieve a single ListModel instance by its primary key (pk). It returns the serialized data of the retrieved instance.

- list: This method handles the GET request to retrieve a list of ListModel instances. It applies pagination, filtering, and ordering based on the specified attributes. It returns a paginated response with the serialized data of the instances.

- create: This method handles the POST request to create a new ListModel instance. It validates the request data, checks for data existence, and saves the new instance. It returns the serialized data of the created instance.

- delete: This method handles the DELETE request to delete a ListModel instance by its primary key (pk). It marks the instance as deleted by setting the is_delete attribute to True. It returns the serialized data of the deleted instance.

- partial_update: This method handles the PATCH request to partially update a ListModel instance by its primary key (pk). It validates the request data, checks for data existence, and updates the specified fields of the instance. It returns the serialized data of the updated instance.

- update: This method handles the PUT request to update a ListModel instance by its primary key (pk). It validates the request data, checks for data existence, and updates all the fields of the instance. It returns the serialized data of the updated instance.

The APIViewSet class also includes the get_project, get_queryset, and get_serializer_class methods.

- get_project: This method retrieves the project ID from the URL kwargs. It returns the project ID if present, otherwise returns None.

- get_queryset: This method returns the queryset of ListModel instances based on the request's authentication and the project ID. If the user is authenticated and the project ID is provided, it filters the instances based on the openid and id fields. Otherwise, it returns an empty queryset.

- get_serializer_class: This method returns the serializer class based on the action of the APIViewSet. It selects the appropriate serializer class based on the action, such as BinsetGetSerializer for list and retrieve actions, BinsetPostSerializer for create action, BinsetUpdateSerializer for update action, and BinsetPartialUpdateSerializer for partial_update action.

In the context of the project, the APIViewSet class is utilized as a view for handling API operations related to the ListModel instances. It is used in conjunction with the MyPageNumberPagination class for pagination, the Filter class for filtering, and various serializer classes for data serialization. The APIViewSet class provides a standardized way to handle CRUD operations for the ListModel instances and ensures consistent behavior across different API endpoints.

**Note**:
Developers using the APIViewSet class should ensure that the authentication, authorization, and validation logic aligns with the requirements of their API endpoints. They should also customize the serializer classes and filter options based on their specific data models and business logic.

    - Output: ListModel.objects.filter(openid=self.request.auth.openid, is_delete=False)
***
### FunctionDef get_serializer_class(self)
**get_serializer_class**: The function of get_serializer_class is to determine and return the appropriate serializer class based on the action being performed.

**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: 
The get_serializer_class function checks the action being performed. If the action is 'list', it returns the FileRenderSerializer class from serializers.py. This serializer is responsible for serializing data related to file rendering with specific attributes and metadata. The FileRenderSerializer class defines fields such as bin_name, bin_size, bin_property, empty_label, creater, create_time, and update_time. It excludes certain fields like 'openid' and 'is_delete' from serialization. 

The FileRenderSerializer is utilized in the FileDownloadView class within the views.py file. When the action is 'list', instances of FileRenderSerializer are generated for each queryset item. This data is then processed to create a response for downloading a CSV file with the appropriate content disposition.

**Note**: Developers using the FileRenderSerializer should handle excluded fields appropriately in their application logic.

**Output Example**:
If the action is 'list', the get_serializer_class function will return the FileRenderSerializer class for serializing file rendering data.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.
- data: The CSV data to be rendered.

**Code Description**:
The get_lang function retrieves the language information from the HTTP headers of the request. If the language is set to 'zh-hans' (Simplified Chinese), the function utilizes the FileRenderCN class to render the CSV data with Chinese headers and labels. Otherwise, it uses the FileRenderEN class for rendering in English. This language-based approach ensures that the CSV files are displayed in the correct language according to user preferences. If no language is specified, the function defaults to using FileRenderEN for rendering.

Within the project structure, the get_lang function is called within the list method of the FileDownloadView class. After retrieving the CSV data using the FileRenderSerializer, the get_lang function is invoked to determine the appropriate renderer based on the language. The resulting renderer is then used to generate a StreamingHttpResponse containing the CSV data with the specified content type. Finally, the response is configured with the appropriate filename and returned to the user for download.

**Note**:
- The get_lang function enhances the localization of CSV data rendering by dynamically selecting the rendering class based on language settings.
- Ensure that the HTTP_LANGUAGE header is correctly set in the request to determine the language for rendering.
- Verify that the FileRenderCN and FileRenderEN classes are properly implemented to handle the rendering of CSV data in the desired languages.
