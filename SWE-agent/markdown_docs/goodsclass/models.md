## ClassDef ListModel
**ListModel**: The function of ListModel is to represent a model for storing information about goods classes.

**attributes**: 
- goods_class: a CharField to store the name of the goods class.
- creater: a CharField to store the creator of the goods class.
- openid: a CharField to store the openid related to the goods class.
- is_delete: a BooleanField to indicate if the goods class is marked for deletion.
- create_time: a DateTimeField to store the timestamp of when the goods class was created.
- update_time: a DateTimeField to store the timestamp of the last update to the goods class.

**Code Description**: 
The ListModel class defines a model with various fields to store information about goods classes. The 'goods_class' field stores the name of the goods class, 'creater' stores the creator's name, 'openid' stores the related openid, 'is_delete' is a boolean field to mark the deletion status, 'create_time' stores the creation timestamp, and 'update_time' stores the last update timestamp. The Meta class within ListModel specifies metadata such as the database table name, verbose names, and default ordering based on the 'goods_class' field.

**Note**: 
Developers can use ListModel to create instances representing different goods classes in the system. The class provides a structured way to manage and store information related to goods classes. When querying or manipulating goods class data, developers can leverage the defined fields and metadata options provided by ListModel.
### ClassDef Meta
**Meta**: The function of Meta is to define metadata options for the ListModel class.

**attributes**:
- db_table: Specifies the database table name for the ListModel class as 'goodsclass'.
- verbose_name: Sets a human-readable name for the ListModel class as 'Goods Class'.
- verbose_name_plural: Provides a plural name for the ListModel class as 'Goods Class'.
- ordering: Defines the default ordering of query results based on the 'goods_class' field.

**Code Description**:
The Meta class in the ListModel class is used to configure various metadata options for the model. In this specific implementation, the db_table attribute is set to 'goodsclass', which indicates the database table name to be used for storing instances of the ListModel class. The verbose_name attribute is assigned 'Goods Class' to provide a readable name for the model in the admin interface. The verbose_name_plural attribute is also set to 'Goods Class' to specify the plural name for the model. Additionally, the ordering attribute is defined with the field 'goods_class', indicating the default ordering of query results based on this field.

**Note**:
Developers can customize the Meta class in Django models to configure various options such as database table name, verbose names, plural names, and default ordering. These options help in managing the behavior and representation of the model in the Django application.
