## ClassDef GoodsclassGetSerializer
**GoodsclassGetSerializer**: The function of GoodsclassGetSerializer is to serialize the data related to goods classes with specific read-only and formatting settings.

**attributes**:
- goods_class: A read-only field for the goods class.
- creater: A read-only field for the creator of the goods class.
- create_time: A read-only DateTime field formatted as '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'.
- update_time: A read-only DateTime field formatted as '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'.

**Code Description**:
The `GoodsclassGetSerializer` class is a subclass of `serializers.ModelSerializer` that defines the serialization behavior for goods class data. It includes specific fields like `goods_class`, `creater`, `create_time`, and `update_time` with read-only and formatting settings. The `Meta` inner class specifies the model to be used, excludes certain fields like 'openid', 'is_delete', and sets 'id' as a read-only field.

In the project, this serializer class is utilized in the `get_serializer_class` method of the APIViewSet in `goodsclass/views.py`. Depending on the action being performed (list, retrieve, destroy, create, update, partial_update), different serializer classes are returned. For the actions related to retrieving goods class data (list, retrieve, destroy), the `GoodsclassGetSerializer` is returned to serialize the data accordingly.

**Note**:
Developers can use this serializer class to serialize goods class data with specific read-only and formatting settings. It is important to ensure that the serializer is used appropriately based on the action being performed to maintain data consistency and integrity.
### ClassDef Meta
**Meta**: The function of Meta is to provide metadata for the GoodsclassGetSerializer class.

**attributes**: 
- model: Specifies the model that the serializer should be based on, in this case, ListModel.
- exclude: Defines a list of fields that should be excluded from the serialization process, such as 'openid' and 'is_delete'.
- read_only_fields: Indicates the fields that should be treated as read-only during serialization, for example, 'id'.

**Code Description**: 
The Meta class in the GoodsclassGetSerializer defines metadata options for the serializer. The 'model' attribute specifies the model that the serializer should use. The 'exclude' attribute lists the fields that should be excluded from the serialized output. In this case, 'openid' and 'is_delete' fields are excluded. The 'read_only_fields' attribute specifies which fields should be treated as read-only during serialization. Here, the 'id' field is marked as read-only.

**Note**: 
It is important to carefully define the metadata options in the Meta class to control how the serializer behaves during the serialization process. Make sure to update the Meta class if there are any changes in the model or serialization requirements.

**Meta**: The function of Meta is to define metadata options for the GoodsclassPostSerializer class.

**attributes**:
- model: Specifies the model class that the serializer should be based on, in this case, ListModel.
- exclude: Defines a list of fields that should be excluded from the serialization process, such as 'is_delete'.
- read_only_fields: Specifies a list of fields that should be treated as read-only during deserialization and validation, including 'id', 'create_time', and 'update_time'.

**Code Description**:
The Meta class within the GoodsclassPostSerializer class is used to provide metadata options for the serializer. In this specific implementation, the model attribute is set to ListModel, indicating the model class that the serializer will be based on. The exclude attribute is used to specify fields that should be excluded from the serialization process, with 'is_delete' being excluded in this case. Additionally, the read_only_fields attribute defines fields that should be treated as read-only during deserialization and validation, with 'id', 'create_time', and 'update_time' marked as read-only.

**Note**:
Developers can customize the behavior of the serializer by adjusting the attributes within the Meta class according to their specific requirements.

## ClassDef GoodsclassUpdateSerializer
**GoodsclassUpdateSerializer**: The function of GoodsclassUpdateSerializer is to serialize and validate the data for updating goods class information.

**attributes**:
- goods_class: A character field for the goods class.
- creater: A character field for the creator of the goods class.
  
**Code Description**:
The GoodsclassUpdateSerializer class is a subclass of the ModelSerializer class provided by Django REST framework. It includes two fields, goods_class, and creater, both of which are instances of the CharField class from the serializers module. The goods_class field is set as read-only and required, with a custom validator data_validate from the datasolve module. Similarly, the creater field is also read-only and required with the same validator.

Within the Meta class, the model attribute is set to ListModel, specifying the model that the serializer should be based on. The exclude attribute is used to specify fields that should be excluded from the serialization process, such as 'openid', 'is_delete'. Additionally, the read_only_fields attribute specifies fields that should be read-only during updates, including 'id', 'create_time', and 'update_time'.

This serializer class is designed to handle the serialization and validation of data when updating goods class information. It ensures that the goods_class and creater fields are required and not read-only, while also applying custom validation logic through the data_validate function.

**Note**:
Developers using this serializer should ensure that the data passed for updating goods class information complies with the validation logic implemented in the data_validate function.
