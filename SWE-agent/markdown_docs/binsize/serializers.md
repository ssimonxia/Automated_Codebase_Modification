## ClassDef BinsizeGetSerializer
**BinsizeGetSerializer**: The function of BinsizeGetSerializer is to serialize data related to bin sizes with specific read-only and optional fields.

**attributes**: 
- bin_size: CharField (read-only, optional)
- bin_size_w: FloatField (read-only, optional)
- bin_size_d: FloatField (read-only, optional)
- bin_size_h: FloatField (read-only, optional)
- creater: CharField (read-only, optional)
- create_time: DateTimeField (read-only, format='%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
- update_time: DateTimeField (read-only, format='%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')

**Code Description**: 
The BinsizeGetSerializer class is a ModelSerializer that defines the serialization behavior for bin size-related data. It includes fields like bin_size, bin_size_w, bin_size_d, bin_size_h, creater, create_time, and update_time. These fields are read-only and optional, allowing them to be included in the serialized data if available. The Meta class specifies the model to be used and excludes certain fields like 'openid', 'is_delete', while setting 'id' as a read-only field.

This serializer class is utilized in the project's APIViewSet to determine the serializer class based on the action being performed. In the APIViewSet's get_serializer_class method, BinsizeGetSerializer is returned when the action is 'list', 'retrieve', or 'destroy'. This ensures that the appropriate serializer is used for these actions to handle bin size data serialization.

**Note**: 
Developers can use BinsizeGetSerializer to serialize bin size data with specific read-only fields and optional attributes. Ensure that the serializer is appropriately selected based on the action being performed within the APIViewSet to maintain consistency in data serialization.

**Code Description**:
The BinsizeUpdateSerializer class is a ModelSerializer that defines the structure and validation rules for serializing bin size update data. It includes fields for bin size, width, depth, height, and the creator of the update. The data validation for these fields is handled by the data_validate function from datasolve.py, which ensures that the input data does not contain potentially harmful content like scripts or select statements.

The Meta class within BinsizeUpdateSerializer specifies the model to be used for serialization (ListModel), excludes certain fields from serialization ('openid', 'is_delete'), and sets specific fields as read-only ('id', 'create_time', 'update_time'). This class is designed to work with the ListModel and enforce the required data structure for bin size updates.

This serializer is utilized in the project by the APIViewSet class in views.py when determining the appropriate serializer class based on the action being performed. When the action is 'update', the BinsizeUpdateSerializer is selected to handle the serialization of data for updating bin sizes.

**Note**:
Developers should ensure that the data being serialized using BinsizeUpdateSerializer adheres to the validation rules set in place to maintain data integrity and security.
### ClassDef Meta
