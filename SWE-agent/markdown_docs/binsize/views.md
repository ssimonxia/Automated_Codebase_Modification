## ClassDef APIViewSet
**APIViewSet**: The function of APIViewSet is to provide CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) operations for ListModel data with specific actions and serializers.

**attributes**:
- pagination_class: MyPageNumberPagination
- filter_backends: [DjangoFilterBackend, OrderingFilter]
- ordering_fields: ['id', "create_time", "update_time"]
- filter_class: Filter

**Code Description**:
APIViewSet class extends viewsets.ModelViewSet and defines various actions such as retrieve, list, create, delete, partial_update, and update for handling ListModel data. It specifies the pagination_class as MyPageNumberPagination, filter_backends for filtering, ordering_fields for ordering, and filter_class as Filter for defining filter options. The class includes methods to retrieve the project ID, get the queryset based on user and project ID, determine the serializer class based on the action, and implement create, update, partial_update, and destroy operations with data validation and permission checks.

In the project, APIViewSet utilizes the Filter class for defining filter options, MyPageNumberPagination for pagination, and different serializers for various actions to interact with ListModel data effectively.

**Note**:
Developers can utilize APIViewSet to perform CRUD operations on ListModel data with tailored actions and serializers. By configuring the pagination, filtering, ordering, and serializer classes, the APIViewSet class provides a structured approach to manage ListModel data within the project's API views.

**Output Example**:
{
    "id": 1,
    "bin_size": "Large",
    "bin_size_w": 10,
    "bin_size_d": 20,
    "bin_size_h": 30,
    "creater": "John Doe",
    "is_delete": false,
    "create_time": "2022-01-01T12:00:00",
    "update_time": "2022-01-02T08:00:00"
}
### FunctionDef get_project(self)
**get_project**: The function of get_project is to retrieve the 'pk' value from the kwargs attribute of the object and return it. 

**parameters**: 
- self: The reference to the current instance of the class.

**Code Description**: 
The get_project function attempts to retrieve the 'pk' value from the kwargs attribute of the object. If successful, it returns the 'pk' value. If an exception occurs during the process, it returns None. 

In the calling object get_queryset, the get_project function is utilized to obtain the 'id' value. Depending on the presence of the 'id' value and the user making the request, the function filters ListModel objects accordingly. If the user is authenticated and 'id' is None, ListModel objects are filtered based on the 'openid' and 'is_delete' attributes. If the user is authenticated and 'id' is not None, ListModel objects are filtered based on the 'openid', 'id', and 'is_delete' attributes. If the user is not authenticated, an empty queryset is returned.

**Note**: 
- The get_project function is designed to handle exceptions and return None if the 'pk' value cannot be retrieved.
- It is important to ensure that the 'pk' value is present in the kwargs attribute to avoid potential errors.

**Output Example**: 
If the 'pk' value is successfully retrieved from the kwargs attribute, the function may return an integer value representing the 'pk'. If an exception occurs, the function will return None.

### FunctionDef get_queryset(self)
**get_queryset**: The function of get_queryset is to filter ListModel objects based on the 'openid', 'id', and 'is_delete' attributes, depending on the user's authentication status and the presence of the 'id' value.

**parameters**: 
- self: The reference to the current instance of the class.

**Code Description**: 
The get_queryset function first calls the get_project function to retrieve the 'id' value. It then checks if the user is authenticated. If authenticated, it further filters ListModel objects based on the 'openid', 'id', and 'is_delete' attributes. If the user is not authenticated, an empty queryset is returned.

In the context of the project, the get_queryset function is a part of the APIViewSet class in views.py. It interacts with the get_project function to determine the filtering criteria for ListModel objects. This function plays a crucial role in providing the appropriate data based on the user's authentication status and the 'id' value.

**Note**: 
- The get_queryset function relies on the get_project function to retrieve the 'id' value, which is used for filtering ListModel objects.
- The function handles different scenarios based on the user's authentication status and the presence of the 'id' value to return the relevant queryset.

**Output Example**: 
- If the user is authenticated and 'id' is None, the function may return a queryset of ListModel objects filtered by 'openid' and 'is_delete' attributes.
- If the user is authenticated and 'id' is not None, the function may return a queryset of ListModel objects filtered by 'openid', 'id', and 'is_delete' attributes.
- If the user is not authenticated, the function will return an empty queryset.

### FunctionDef get_serializer_class(self)
**get_serializer_class**: The function of get_serializer_class is to determine the appropriate serializer class based on the action being performed within the APIViewSet.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.
  
**Code Description**:
The get_serializer_class function checks the action being performed and returns the corresponding serializer class based on the action. If the action is 'list', 'retrieve', or 'destroy', it returns the BinsizeGetSerializer. For 'create', it returns BinsizePostSerializer. If the action is 'update', BinsizeUpdateSerializer is returned, and for 'partial_update', BinsizePartialUpdateSerializer is returned. If none of these conditions match, it calls the http_method_not_allowed method.

This function ensures that the appropriate serializer is used for each action to handle the serialization of bin size data effectively within the APIViewSet.

**Note**:
Developers should ensure that the actions and corresponding serializer classes are correctly mapped to maintain consistency in data serialization.

**Output Example**:
```python
return serializers.BinsizeGetSerializer
```

### FunctionDef create(self, request)
**create**: The function of create is to handle the creation of a new object based on the incoming request data.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.
- request: The incoming request object.
- *args: Additional positional arguments.
- **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments.

**Code Description**:
The create function first retrieves the data from the incoming request. It then adds the 'openid' value from the request's authentication information to the data. The function checks if an object with the same 'openid' and 'bin_size' values already exists in the ListModel. If the object exists, it raises an APIException with a message indicating that the data already exists. If the object does not exist, it proceeds to serialize the data, validate it, save it, and return a response with the serialized data and a success status code along with the appropriate headers.

**Note**:
- This function assumes the existence of a ListModel to perform the data check and serialization.
- The function relies on the request object to access data and authentication information.

**Output Example**:
```json

    "id": 1,
    "bin_size": "large",
    "openid": "example_openid",
    "is_delete": false
}
```
***
### FunctionDef update(self, request, pk)
**update**: The function of update is to update data if the authenticated user is the owner of the data, otherwise, it raises an exception.

**parameters**:
- request: The HTTP request object.
- pk: The primary key of the object to be updated.

**Code Description**:
The update function first retrieves the object to be updated using the get_object method. It then checks if the openid of the object matches the openid of the authenticated user. If they do not match, an APIException is raised indicating that the data cannot be updated as it does not belong to the user. If the openids match, the function proceeds to update the data using the request data. The function then validates the serializer with the provided data, saves the serializer, retrieves success headers, and returns a response with the updated data and a status code of 200.

**Note**:
- This function assumes the presence of a get_object method to retrieve the object to be updated.
- The function relies on the presence of a serializer to validate and save the updated data.
- The function requires authentication to determine ownership of the data being updated.

**Output Example**:
{
    "field1": "updated_value1",
    "field2": "updated_value2",
    ...
}
***
### FunctionDef partial_update(self, request, pk)
**partial_update**: The function of partial_update is to partially update an object based on the provided data.

**parameters**:
- self: The reference to the current instance of the class.
- request: The request object containing metadata about the request.
- pk: The primary key of the object to be updated.

**Code Description**:
The partial_update function first retrieves the object to be updated using the get_object method. It then checks if the openid of the object matches the openid of the authenticated user. If not, it raises an APIException indicating that the data cannot be updated. If the openids match, the function proceeds to update the object with the provided data. It uses the serializer to validate the data, saves the changes, and retrieves the success headers before returning a response with the updated data.

**Note**:
It is important to ensure that the authentication mechanism is in place to prevent unauthorized updates to the data.

**Output Example**:
{
    "field1": "updated_value1",
    "field2": "updated_value2",
    ...
}
***
### FunctionDef destroy(self, request, pk)
**destroy**: The function of destroy is to delete a specific object if the authenticated user owns it.

**parameters**:
- request: Represents the request made to the server.
- pk: Represents the primary key of the object to be deleted.

**Code Description**:
The destroy function first retrieves the object to be deleted using the get_object method. It then checks if the openid of the object does not match the openid of the authenticated user, in which case it raises an APIException indicating that the data cannot be deleted as it does not belong to the user. If the ownership check passes, the function sets the is_delete attribute of the object to True and saves the changes. It then serializes the updated object, retrieves the success headers, and returns a response with the serialized data and a status code of 200.

**Note**:
Ensure that the ownership check logic is appropriate for your application's security requirements.

***
### FunctionDef get_serializer_class(self)
**get_serializer_class**: The function of get_serializer_class is to determine and return the appropriate serializer class based on the action being performed.

**parameters**:
- self: the instance of the class

**Code Description**:
The get_serializer_class function checks the action being performed. If the action is 'list', it returns the FileRenderSerializer class from the serializers module. Otherwise, it calls the http_method_not_allowed method to handle the request.

The FileRenderSerializer class is responsible for serializing and deserializing data related to bin sizes for file rendering. It contains fields such as bin_size, bin_size_w, bin_size_d, bin_size_h, creater, create_time, and update_time. This serializer class is utilized within the FileDownloadView class to generate data for file rendering in CSV format.

When the get_serializer_class function is called within the FileDownloadView class, it ensures that the appropriate serializer class, FileRenderSerializer, is returned for the 'list' action. This allows for efficient serialization of bin size data for file rendering purposes.

**Note**:
Developers should ensure that the action being checked aligns with the expected behavior to retrieve the correct serializer class. Proper configuration and utilization of the FileRenderSerializer class are essential for handling bin size data serialization effectively.
