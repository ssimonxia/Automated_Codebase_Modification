## ClassDef ListModel
**ListModel**: The function of ListModel is to represent a model for storing information about bin sizes.

**attributes**: 
- bin_size: a CharField to store the name of the bin.
- bin_size_w: a FloatField to store the width of the bin.
- bin_size_d: a FloatField to store the depth of the bin.
- bin_size_h: a FloatField to store the height of the bin.
- creater: a CharField to store the creator of the bin.
- openid: a CharField to store the Openid associated with the bin.
- is_delete: a BooleanField to label if the bin is deleted.
- create_time: a DateTimeField to store the creation time of the bin.
- update_time: a DateTimeField to store the last update time of the bin.

**Code Description**: 
The ListModel class defines a model with various fields to store information related to bin sizes. It includes fields for the name of the bin, its dimensions (width, depth, height), creator information, Openid, deletion status, creation time, and last update time. Additionally, the class Meta inside the model specifies the database table name, verbose names for the model, and the default ordering based on the 'id' field in descending order.

**Note**: 
Developers can use this model to create instances representing different bin sizes in the system. The fields provided offer a comprehensive set of attributes to manage and track bin size data effectively.
### ClassDef Meta
**Meta**: The function of Meta is to define metadata options for the ListModel class.

**attributes**:
- db_table: Specifies the database table name for the ListModel class.
- verbose_name: Sets a human-readable name for a single object of the ListModel class.
- verbose_name_plural: Provides a human-readable name for the ListModel class in plural form.
- ordering: Defines the default ordering for queries on the ListModel class.

**Code Description**:
The Meta class within the ListModel class in models.py file is used to configure metadata options for the ListModel class. 
- The db_table attribute is set to 'binsize', indicating the name of the database table associated with the ListModel class.
- verbose_name is assigned the value 'Bin Size', representing a readable name for a single object of the ListModel class.
- verbose_name_plural is set to "Bin Size", providing a human-readable name for the ListModel class in its plural form.
- The ordering attribute is configured with ['-id'], specifying the default ordering of objects retrieved from the database. In this case, the objects will be ordered in descending order based on the 'id' field.

**Note**:
Developers can customize the behavior of the ListModel class by adjusting the attributes within the Meta class according to their specific requirements.
