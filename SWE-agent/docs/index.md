# SWE-agent

![test](assets/readme_assets/swe-agent-banner.png)

SWE-agent turns LMs (e.g. GPT-4) into software engineering agents that can fix bugs and issues in real GitHub repositories.

On [SWE-bench](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/SWE-bench), SWE-agent resolves **12.29%** of issues, achieving the state-of-the-art performance on the full test set.

We accomplish our results by designing simple LM-centric commands and feedback formats to make it easier for the LM to browse the repository, view, edit and execute code files. We call this an ðŸ¤– **Agent-Computer Interface (ACI)**.
Read more about it in our [paper](https://swe-agent.com/paper.pdf)!

SWE-agent is built and maintained by researchers from Princeton University.
